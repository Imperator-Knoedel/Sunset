		<English>Academia refers to an organised community of teachers, educators and researches. The term academia originates from tradition of the classical academy in ancient Greece, especially the Academy of Plato. This early academy was a place where philosophers could teach and their followers assemble and study their philosophies.
 
This ideas was revived in Italy during the 15th century, in particular in Florence and Rome. This new form of academy was influenced by the existing traditions of medieval universities and humanist studies in Christian Europe. Over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, academies for a variety of fields such as science, linguistics, the arts, the military, literature and philosophy were founded all over Europe, often with the sponsorship of the government.
 
The idea of academia fostered the exchange of ideas and dialogue between people active in these fields and is generally regarded as antecedent to the subsequent development of the scientific method, the modern university and modern forms of research.</English>

		<English>Aerodynamics is the study of designing objects so that they will go smoothly through the air, rather than having to constantly waste energy battering through air resistance.

In the early days of flight, aerodynamics was a somewhat informal science, and advances in engine power that gave aircraft more brute-force ability to push through the air were often more important. This began to change in the 1920s and 1930s, when aerodynamic designs became more popular not only for monocoque-hulled aircraft, but also for trains and automobiles.

Aerodynamics became all the more important when engineers attempted to design more complex and advanced aircraft, such as helicopters (which are inherently unstable, and must be designed carefully to be flyable) and supersonic jets (since passing the speed of sound can rip an aircraft to pieces if the design fails to deflect and make use of shockwaves created by breaking the sound barrier).

Today, aerodynamic calculations can be made in greater detail and thoroughness than ever before, using powerful computers. This allows designers to extract the greatest possible speed and efficiency out of a given amount of engine power.</English>

		<English>Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with questions of art and beauty. Every culture in the world has its own Aesthetics, the study of art being nearly as old as art itself. Modern Aesthetics delves into all forms of art - theater, poetry, literature, film, etc. - but in its earliest form, aesthetics dealt largely with the visual arts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While clashing senses of Aesthetics have caused many squabbles in their times, one city has been the center of some of the most violent artistic struggles throughout history - Istanbul. During the ninth century, Christian killed Christian in the city then known as Constantinople as the followers of Christ attempted to decide whether religious icons should be considered blasphemous. With the conquest of the city by the Ottomans, previous artistic works deemed offensive were removed or vandalized. Inside the Hagia Sophia, mosaics of Christian religious figures were covered with plaster, that only now, several hundred years later, are finally being revealed.</English>

<English>Alchemy is the study of chemical substances, in its pre-scientific form. This was often an informal art; mysticism and superstition were mixed seamlessly with pragmatic efforts to manipulate flame, metal, and liquids. Many alchemists sought out impossible goals such as the universal solvent, the elixir of youth, the secret of immortality, or means by which common metals like iron or lead might be transmuted into gold. Alchemy was fraught with frauds, cheats, and liars.

However, alchemists made real contributions to society. Alchemists were the first to invent many of the basic techniques of processing chemicals, and the equipment needed to do so. Operating on a rough-and-ready empirical basis, they were able to develop substances such as acids, distilled alcoholic spirits, incendiaries, and gunpowder, which had great effects on their societies in both war and peace.</English>

		<English>Evidence of the use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, dates back to Thailand in 4500 BC. Several hundred years later, bronze working was discovered in the Middle East. Artifacts from this period show that bronze was initially used for decorative purposes only. This is because tin was not readily available. It wasn't until approximately 2000 BC, when tin was regularly imported from neighboring regions, that bronze replaced copper in the construction of larger items. Bronze was harder and less brittle than copper, and it held a sharper edge. Tools, weapons, and armor made from bronze were also cheaper to produce and more durable. The period of time when bronze was the metal of choice for such items was known as the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age lasted until iron working became prevalent in approximately 1200 BC.</English>

Les objets datant de cette p&#233;riode montrent que le bronze &#233;tait uniquement utilis&#233; &#224; l'origine dans un but d&#233;coratif. Il rempla&#231;ait l'&#233;tain, plus difficile &#224; obtenir. Ce n'est que vers 2 000 av. J.-C., quand l'&#233;tain a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;guli&#232;rement import&#233; des r&#233;gions voisines, que le bronze a remplac&#233; le cuivre dans la fabrication d'objets de plus grande taille. Le bronze &#233;tait plus solide et moins cassant que le cuivre et permettait de produire des lames plus tranchantes. Les outils, armes, et armures en bronze &#233;taient aussi moins chers &#224; produire et plus r&#233;sistants. La p&#233;riode au cours de laquelle le bronze a &#233;t&#233; le m&#233;tal privil&#233;gi&#233; pour ce genre d'objets est connue sous le nom de l'Age de Bronze, p&#233;riode qui a perdur&#233; jusqu'au d&#233;veloppement du travail de fer, vers 1 200 av.

		<German>Es wird vermutet, dass Bronze, eine Legierung aus Kupfer und Zinn, bereits im Jahre 4500 vor Christus in Thailand verwendet wurde. Mehrere Jahrhunderte sp&#228;ter wurde die Bronzeverarbeitung im Nahen Osten entdeckt. Kunstwerke dieser Periode zeigen, dass Bronze anfangs nur zu Dekorationszwecken genutzt wurde, weil Zinn schwer zu beschaffen war. Erst um etwa 2000 vor Christus wurde Zinn regelm&#228;&#223;ig von den benachbarten L&#228;ndern importiert. In der Folgezeit wurde das bis dahin verwendete Kupfer bei der Herstellung gr&#246;&#223;erer Objekte durch Bronze ersetzt, die h&#228;rter und weniger spr&#246;de war als Kupfer, so dass sich damit sch&#228;rfere Kanten formen lie&#223;en - dar&#252;ber hinaus waren Werkzeuge, Waffen und R&#252;stungen aus Bronze auch preiswerter und langlebiger. Die Zeit, in der Bronze das bevorzugte Metall f&#252;r die Fertigung dieser Ger&#228;te war, ist als Bronzezeitalter bekannt. Diese Periode dauerte bis etwa 1200 vor Christus, als das noch hochwertigere Eisen verf&#252;gbar wurde.</German>
		<Italian>Le prime testimonianze sull'uso del bronzo, una lega di rame e stagno, risalgono alla Thailandia del 4500 a. C. Diversi secoli più tardi, la lavorazione del bronzo venne scoperta nel Medio Oriente. Gli oggetti risalenti a questo periodo dimostrano che il bronzo veniva inizialmente utilizzato solo a scopo decorativo, questo perché lo stagno non era facilmente reperibile. Bisognerà aspettare più o meno il 2000 a. C. perché, con l'importazione regolare di stagno dalle regioni confinanti, il bronzo sostituisca il rame nella fabbricazione di oggetti più grandi, offrendo anche una maggior resistenza rispetto al rame e la possibilità di produrre punte più acuminate. Strumenti, armi e armature di bronzo erano anche meno costosi da realizzare e più duraturi. Il periodo di tempo in cui si preferiva il bronzo per tali prodotti è noto come l'Età del Bronzo, che durò fino al 1200 a. C. circa, quando fu soppiantato dalla lavorazione del ferro.</Italian>

		<English>Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between them - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis.
 
The earliest written records indicate the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000 BC. The hieroglyphic system for Egyptian numerals, like the later Roman numerals, descended from tally marks used for counting. Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the sexagesimal (base 60) system for Babylonian numerals and the vigesimal (base 20) system that defined Maya numerals. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.
 
The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of Euclid around 300 BC, Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. Greek numerals were used by Archimedes, Diophantus and others in a positional notation not very different from ours.</English>

<English>As computer technology advances its capabilities at a geometric rate, the ability of computer software to emulate intelligent decisions grows. Automation first replaces  routine, mundane labor on assembly lines, then an increasing share of service and office jobs. As the process continues, it seems likely that computers will become able to sustain true intelligence, at least for a pragmatic definition of the term.

Some predict that the creation of the first artificial intelligences will lead to a 'singularity' beyond which we lose our ability to predict the course of human development: these AIs will rapidly begin to modify and improve themselves until their capabilities are little short of godlike. Others feel that this is an exaggeration of the possibilities. Regardless, artificial intelligence is likely to play a prominent role in the development of human society in the future.</English>

		<English>In the early days of seafaring, sailors operated solely through a process known as "piloting", in which the position and course of the ship was determined by referring to geographical landmarks. The need to stay in view of the shore severely limited the extent of sea voyages. Through experience, sailors learned to apply the science of astronomy to their profession, noting the positions and movement of particular stars. They realized that even when the shore was out of sight, they could steer by certain reliable stars. This crude, yet practical application of astronomy allowed the adventurous to sail into the unknown with a reasonable chance of finding their way. As a result, ship building technology quickly improved, producing larger, more stable ships designed for longer voyages.</English>

		<English>Geography is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word geography was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexities - not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography.
 
The European Age of Discovery during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as Christopher Columbus, Marco Polo, and James Cook revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe.
 
The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete academic discipline, and became part of a typical university curriculum in Europe (especially Paris and Berlin).</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_ATOMIC_PHYSICS_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Atomic theory is, in simplest form, the idea that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called "atoms." The first ancient form of this theory comes from the Greek philosopher Democritus. His atomic theory was founded on the Greek ideas of the geometric order of the universe and of the four elements, which led to some strange ideas. For instance, early supporters of the atomic theory suggested that water might flow because it was made up of icosahedral atoms which, being nearly round, tumbled over each other easily; fire was painful because it was made up of tetrahedral atoms which were sharp and thus damaging. Since there was no evidence for this theory at the time, and no obvious reason to prefer it to the alternatives, it was largely ignored for the following two thousand years.

The atomic theory re-emerged around 1800, following early chemists' discovery of new types of chemical elements that seemed more fundamental than things like air and fire. The chemist John Dalton proposed again that all matter was made of atoms, which were neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions, only reshuffled to form different substances. This theory proved fruitful for 19th century chemistry, although many scientists insisted that it was only a theory.

Towards the end of the century, advances in the studies of the spectrum of light emitted by different elements, and the discovery of radioactivity, cast doubt on the premise that atoms were indivisible. Perhaps atoms had some kind of internal structure, and were themselves composed of smaller particles with new and intriguing properties of their own. The first of these particles to be discovered was the electron, a tiny and lightweight particle which carries a strong negative charge, and whose motions form the basis for nearly all electrical, magnetic, and chemical interactions.

Further investigation into the structure of the atom using ever more precise and complex instruments and mathematical theories opened up broad vistas of scientific discovery. Various models of atomic structure, such as the "plum pudding" model, the Rutherford atom, and the Bohr atom, were considered, modified, or discarded. Scientists gained more understanding of the mechanisms behind atomic structure, and of how atoms could bind together to form molecules.

This led to great advances in practical technology in the latter half of the 20th century. Once the atoms that made them up were understood, chemists could tailor-make molecules to suit their needs. Alloys with strange electrical properties could be used to build advanced calculating machines. And the immense forces locked within the atomic nucleus could be released, for good or for evil.</English>

<English>Automation is the art of making machines which perform tasks on their own, without active input or oversight from a human operator. Automatic constructs have existed as toys for the rich since ancient times, the products of individual craftsmanship, but widespread use of automation to control machines is a twentieth-century phenomenon.

The demand for automation first came from the need to make machinery function where humans cannot or will not; be it in an extremely hostile environment, in a factory where machines ran faster than the human eye can follow, or in a job too menial and unstimulating for the average person to be content doing. Over time, automation has become more popular and flexible, especially with the rise of electronic computers.

Automatic equipment invariably saves human labor, but it also displaces labour. The simple tasks involved in doing the machine's job are replaced by specialized jobs tending the machines. Or not replaced at all.</English>

		<English>The earliest attempts at producing a self-propelled vehicle date back to the late 1770s. These early vehicles used bulky steam engines for power. Despite constant improvements, the steam engine ultimately proved impractical for small vehicles. The development of the internal combustion engine in the late 1800s provided a small but powerful replacement for steam engines, and were able to achieve much higher speeds. The first practical automobiles were developed in the late 19th century, by automotive pioneers in France, Germany, and the United States. By the 1920s, a number of automotive manufacturing companies were operating in the U.S., including Ford and General Motors. By 1980, more than 300 million cars and 85 million trucks were in operation throughout the world. The popularity of the automobile has led to massive improvements in the highway systems in most industrialized countries. Unfortunately, automobiles are also one of the primary sources of air pollution, and have resulted in an all time high demand for petrochemical fuels.</English>

They might become popular as replacements or augmentations for functioning body parts - if an artificial eye sees more clearly, some may prefer it to their natural one. Taken to its logical extreme, bionics might even cause us to call into question the very meaning of what it is to be human, an issue mostly considered the province of science fiction to date.</English>

		<English>Cartography is the art of making maps. Since any traveler will do well to have maps of the territory they move through, good maps have been in demand for as long as the art of writing made it possible to create them. Early maps were often crude, with the shapes of continents and the relative position of cities and landmarks grossly distorted. Portions of the map with which the artist was unfamiliar were often decorated with fanciful place-names and the images of fictional creatures, as in the famous "here there be dragons."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cartography became more of a science during the medieval period, with advances in mathematics and surveying techniques. Growing and spreading populations helped as well - it's easier and more practical to make an accurate map of cultivated fields and townships than of a howling wilderness. During the European Age of Exploration, the art of mapmaking advanced hand in hand with the art of navigation - the one being nearly impossible without the other.</English>

		<English>A ceremony is an event of ritual significance, performed on a special occasion. Even in the earliest societies, religious beliefs were often associated with recurring events that required the performance of ceremonies. These ceremonies could take place in smaller, secluded communities, such as in temples, or in public on squares and marketplaces.
 
Ceremonies often strengthen the solidarity within a society and create a sense of belonging and loyalty to the authorities that were organising them. For that reason, they were often employed by monarchs to legitimise their rule, for example through triumphal marches, coronation ceremonies or complicated court rituals.
 
This complicated ceremonial procedure meant that there was only a limited class of people capable of administering rituals. Over time, this led to the emergence of formal priesthood and organised religion.</English>

		<English>Charity is the virtue of willingness to give, to use one's time, resources, and influence for the benefit of others who need those things. Charity has been an ideal promoted by many cultures and numerous world religions throughout history. In the earliest recorded times and simplest known national governments, the charity of leaders such as kings and priests allowed an orderly redistribution of wealth. This served to take place of the traditional reciprocal behaviours of tribal cultures, implementing sharing and mutual protection on a larger scale.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the complexity of social systems and the philosophical refinement of social mores evolved through the ages, the practice of charity by hierarchies grew more pronounced. In the modern era, virtually all developed societies provide some degree of organized charity to the groups they deem vulnerable, such as children, the elderly, single parents, the unemployed, the sick, workers in economic sectors threatened by social, economic, and technological change, or underdeveloped foreign countries. This practice is augmented by similar charity practiced by private individuals (e.g. the Gates Foundation) and international organizations (e.g. Medicins Sans Frontieres).</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_CIVIL_LIBERTIES_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Civil liberties are forms of freedom of action which the state is required to give to all citizens, without limits or with very minimal limits.

The idea that one's standing in society confers certain rights is ancien t- most traditional societies grant special immunities to nobles and priests, granting them more room to speak their minds and more confidence of avoiding practices like torture and arbitrary arrest. But in most of the world, the notion that these rights should be universal is relatively new. Similarly, the belief that they should apply without exception even when the state has an interest in ignoring them, as a matter of principle date back to no earlier than the Enlightenment of the 1600s and 1700s.

Key among these basic rights are freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, and freedom from arbitrary use of police powers. Removing any of these rights makes it far easier for a tyrannical government to suppress dissent, while keeping them in place helps to ensure that the state remains honest, forthright, and responsible in its dealings with the citizenry.</English>

<English>Certain inequalities have been a feature of most civilizations since the beginning of recorded history, or earlier. Almost without exception, most women were restricted to low-prestige roles as subordinates to men. Many societies identified a ruling elite or 'native' national majority which was free to condemn religious, racial, or other minorities. Large categories of second-class citizens existed in practically all countries, most frequently women, who lacked the political and economic freedoms enjoyed by men.

As great increases in wealth, literacy, and access to communications spread through the developed world in the late 19th and early 20th century, this state of affairs was called into question. Women and racial minorities struggled to achieve equal access to economic opportunities and for the right to vote. Ethnic and linguistic groups overpowered and surrounded by foreigners (especially in the Americas and Australia) fought to preserve their right to raise their own children and maintain their language and traditions in the face of intense pressure to dissolve into the mainstream. In recent decades, issues of sexuality and gender identity have sparked much debate and protest between those striving for equality and those that would deny it to them.

The battles for these forms of equality, generally known as "civil rights" were one of the defining social forces of the 20th century, and continue into the 21st.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_CIVIL_SERVICE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Civil Service is the technology of bureaucracy - organizing and running a government. A successful civil service requires standard procedures, division of responsibility, hierarchy, and advancement through merit. Record-keeping is crucial to the successful management of a government, as well. While some early cultures kept records on clay or wax or stone tablets, the advent of paper was a boon to the advance of bureaucracy and a civil service.

One of the oldest known civil services is found in China, during the Tang dynasty (600 - 900 CE). This was created largely in response to the Confucian demands for honest government; among other innovations, the Tang civil servants were hired based upon the results of a written examination, rather than through the more common methods of bribery and patronage, and thus had fewer ties to the wealthy and powerful nobility. The English followed the Chinese civil service model when they created a bureaucracy to manage their growing colonies. Though successful, the practice did not spread to Europe until the mid-18th century.</English>

		<English>Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other)
 
The 17th century saw increasing use of combined arms at lower (regimental) level. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was the proponent of the idea. For fire support he attached teams of "commanded musketeers" to cavalry units and fielded light 3-pounder guns to provide infantry units with organic artillery.

In the eighteenth century, the concept of the legion was revived. Legions now consisted of musketeers, light infantry, dragoons and artillery in a brigade sized force. These legions often combined professional military personnel with militia. Perhaps the most notable example is the use of light cavalry, light infantry and light horse artillery in advance detachments by France's La Grande Armée during the Napoleonic Wars.</English>

		<English>An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which is then used to create a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy.
 
Internal combustion piston engines  were tested in France in 1807 by de Rivaz and independently, by the Niépce brothers. They were theoretically advanced by Carnot in 1824. In 1853-57 Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented an engine using the free-piston principle that was possibly the first 4-cycle engine.
 
The invention of an internal combustion engine which was later commercially successful was made during 1860 by Etienne Lenoir. The Otto cycle in 1877 was capable of giving a far higher power to weight ratio than steam engines and worked much better for many transportation applications such as cars and aircraft.</English>

Composites were used quite early in human history; composite bows have been discovered dating back to 1300 BC. The composite technology refers the late 20th Century invention of various metal and plastic composites with greater strength, lightness, and other special properties than the base materials.

Kevlar, the modern battle armor, is a composite material. Modern tanks are constructed of steel-boron nitride composites. Stealth airplanes use composite materials that are much more difficult to spot on radar. The tungsten-carbide composite is used in drill bits and wedding rings. Composite materials often demand extremely complex and precise manufacturing processes. However expensive the process may be, the resulting material may have superior qualities that make them more than worth the expense.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_SOCIAL_CONTRACT_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>In both moral and political philosophy, the social contract or political contract is a theory or model, originating during the Age of Enlightenment, that typically addresses the questions of the origin of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate (or to the decision of a majority), in exchange for protection of their remaining rights. The question of the relation between natural and legal rights, therefore, is often an aspect of social contract theory.
 
Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law, the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the "state of nature". In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.</English>

		<English>A contract is a voluntary arrangement between two or more parties that is enforceable by law as a binding legal agreement. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.
 
In The Laws, Plato recognized the same basic categories for cancelling agreements as exist today. Roman law identified discrete categories of contractual transaction, each with its own requirements, which needed to be fulfilled in order for promises to be enforced. More than appeared from the general rules in Ancient Greece, Roman law represented an early division between specific kinds of contract, depending on the transaction's nature.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_CROP_ROTATION_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Crop rotation is the practice of planting different species of crops in the same field in a continuous cycle. This is extremely useful as a way to improve farm productivity, because any given crop will absorb certain nutrients from the soil while leaving others in place or even enriching them. Over time, growing the same crops in a field over and over will exhaust its nutrients and make it useless. By rotating crops, a farmer can intersperse these periods of nutrient drain with periods where the crops actively replenish the soil; this is often achieved using legume crops such as beans, which enrich soil with nitrogen that many other plants need to grow.

Crop rotation was introduced in various parts of the world during the classical and medieval periods. Over time it has become a more complex practice; each improvement in crop rotation practices provided a boost in agricultural productivity. While today, chemical fertilizers often take the place of crop rotation by replacing soil nutrients artificially, crop rotation remains an important technique for farmers to know, especially if they wish to avoid relying totally on the fertilizer supply.</English>

<English>Cybernetics is a term coined by pioneering computer scientist Norbert Wiener, referring to the science of studying control systems, organization, and information flow. This is a relatively new field of research, dating to the mid-20th century. Cyberneticists seek to understand how decisions are made, and how to improve the process using systematic, scientific methods. This is particularly important in the fields of automation and computer programming. Setting up a computer to do a job in a human's place cannot be done unless the computer's programmers and users understand how it is to make the necessary decisions: how the computer 'thinks.' Cybernetics also finds use in management of human beings, because its theories can be applied to the flow of information and decisions up and down a chain of command, among a peer group, or through other social structures.

More colloquially, "cybernetics" is often used to refer to advanced automation, or to a mixture of organic and machine technology, particularly in the context of the newly-dawning Information Age. Naturally, this is tied into the research described above - one can hardly design an advanced robot without knowing how to build a decision-making computer.</English>

<English>People of the ancient world were fascinated and awed by the forces of nature surrounding them. Earthquakes, storms and other phenomena were generally regarded as signs from heaven. Individuals and groups arose to formulate explanations for these events, and pass the knowledge along to the tribe. The priests and priestesses of mysticism, often called oracles, claimed union with the divine through meditation and trance-like contemplation.

Oracles across the world developed complex rites and rituals to appease and interact with gods and spirits. One of the most common forms of supernatural power invoked was divination - the ability to foretell the future using signs and portents such as dreams, the motions of the stars, the guts of sacrificial animals, the fracture lines in a tortoise's shell, visions experienced while under the influence of various drugs, and so on. Divination served the common human need to obtain information about the unknown future.</English>

<English>"Dogma" refers to a firmly established body of beliefs and opinions, generally associated with religion and laid out by respected theologians within the faith. Within that religion, the dogma is considered authoritative and final - it may be clarified or expanded upon, but not contradicted. To call the basic facts of the dogma into question is, by definition, to leave the religion for some other path which may be deemed heretical.

Different religions have different core bodies of dogma, which usually focus on key points of doctrine that the religious leaders consider to be of extreme importance. In Christianity, the concept of salvation through faith in Christ is a matter of dogma, although the details of how this salvation may best be achieved can vary. In Islam, it is a point of dogma that Muhammed was the last of the divinely inspired prophets.

Dogma is particularly important to organized religions, since it serves to define the limits of what can and cannot be accepted as part of the faith. Learning the basic principles outlined by the dogma is considered the universal foundation of education within the religious tradition, and among the scholarly figures of the religion, all knowledge and all philosophy is likely to be interpreted through the dogma's lens. Groups which defy dogma are often forced to recant, removed from positions of official responsibility, and even violently persecuted until they rejoin the fold, flee, or die.

The concept of points of dogma that a society will not tolerate violation of is not unique to religion. Many totalitarian societies feature secular political 'dogma', de facto or de jure, which cannot be violated without the hostile attentions of the state.</English>

Vacuum tubes also allowed music and voice to be superimposed onto radio waves for transmission. The early study of electronics revolutionized a number of fields, especially the field of communications. Because of the vacuum tube, the technology of radio communications was highly developed by World War II. After the war, electronics research continued to advance rapidly.

This has preoccupied thinkers since ancient times, but formal discussion and contemplation of ethics as a logic-based endeavour, as distinct from traditions of religious or secular law, are mostly a product of the classical and medieval periods.

Different cultures produce widely divergent schools of ethics, ranging from the law-oriented systems common in China to the relatively individualist virtue-ethical schools of the ancient Greeks. Ethics may be highly abstract or applied as a practical matter to questions of professional conduct and personal behavior. They may emphasize the intent of the moral actor, the fulfillment of certain laws and precepts, the consequences of the action itself, or any combination of the above.</English>

<English>Evangelism is an interpretation of religion which sees expanding itself as a sacred duty. This view begins with the idea of a specific religion as being at the centre of one's existence. To the evangelist, it isn't simply a matter of appeasing one's own gods, with other people having other gods. It isn't a matter of trying to become personally enlightened. No, this enlightenment must be spread to others, or the reverence of this god must be something that it would be good for everyone to share.

Therefore, to the evangelist, the very existence of unbelievers is a disastrous state of the world. It is a crisis facing the souls of the human race, an emptiness in the collective spirit of humanity, and possibly a personal insult as well. Evangelists will go forth and preach to others, converting outsiders to the faith, and to their own specific versions of the faith- by hook or by crook.</English>

<English>The earliest intercontinental explorers were part of government-funded expeditions, as with Zheng He, Christopher Columbus, and Bartholomew Diaz. Soon it became clear that there were vast riches to be had from trade in luxury goods with remote lands, and where long range seafaring continued to thrive, private enterprise soon followed.

For the people of the time, a trip from Europe to trade for spices, gems, silk and other precious goods in Asia was immensely time-consuming, requiring the most advanced ships and years of time and effort by a crew of skilled sailors. Quite a few ships that attempted the voyage never made it back, being destroyed by storms or hostile locals over the tens of thousands of kilometres of sea voyage.

The risks involved created a powerful incentive to limit the financial hazards of the trip - any one merchant who invested in such an expedition might be ruined if something went wrong. Groups of wealthy men began to organize 'companies', bands that would pool their resources and share the costs of the long, immensely profitable trips.

Some of these companies were able to secure royal guarantees from their home nations of exclusive trading rights- early examples include the English, Dutch, and French East India Companies. Over time, these organizations became extremely powerful, as the first ancestors of the modern multinational corporation.</English>

		<English>An explosive is a chemical compound or mixture that undergoes rapid combustion and produces heat, gas, and pressure effects. The earliest explosive compound known was gunpowder, which was first used in the13th century, and was the only explosive known for hundreds of years. The first modern explosive, a compound known as nitroglycerin, was discovered in 1846. Compounds similar to nitroglycerin are the most commonly used explosives today. Explosives vary in brisance, or shattering effect, and in their stability under various environmental conditions. Aside from their obvious use in weaponry, explosives are also used in such peaceful applications as rocket propellants and for mining and demolition work.</English>

<English>Fertilizers are substances which increase the fertility of soil by introducing nutrients that are often lacking. Since deficiencies in substances like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are often bottlenecks in plant growth, fertilizer makes plants to grow larger and more quickly. This is especially desirable in agriculture as it allows the same land to feed more people.

Fertilization has been a common practice throughout the civilized world since prehistoric times. Farmers in nearly all places fertilized their fields with simple materials like animal (or human) dung, ground-up fish remains, or potsherds (most fertile soil in the Amazon basin is laced with broken pottery, and this appears to have been deliberate on the natives' part).
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the range of available fertilizers grew dramatically. Industrial-scale extraction of minerals, particularly nitrates and phosphates, allowed vast increases in farm output. Advances in industrial chemistry allowed factories to create fully synthetic fertilizers too, using customized organic molecules to speed the growth of crops and inhibit the growth of weeds and parasites. This contributes to the success of the "Green Revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s at feeding a world population of seven billion and rising.

In general, fertilizer achieves varying success. Used carelessly, it may not contribute to soil fertility (adding more of what's already there is pointless), or even decrease it (adding enough phosphorus to maximize growth may result in all the carbon in the soil being used up quickly). This is a particularly serious problem with "Green Revolution" crops in the modern era. Furthermore, careless or excessive use can lead to fertilizer seeping into waterways, causing oxygen depletion, algal blooms, and other ecological problems.</English>

<English>Land tenure is the idea of a fixed, legalized ownership of land with a formal relationship between the landowner and their ruler. "Tenure" comes from a root verb meaning "to hold" the land in question. Under a land tenure system, all land is the property of the sovereign by default, but this land is granted to trusted individuals in permanent, usually inherited titles. This forms the foundation of what we now know as feudalism. In exchange for a grant of land for themself and their heirs, a feudal noble might promise to supply their ruler with troops, money, food, or other goods obtained from the productivity of the land itself.

This saved the monarch from the burden of administering the territory directly and trying to collect taxes from it, and created a large class of aristocrats who owed their fortune and power to the throne. The pattern of tenancy could be scaled up and down easily, ranging from great territories held by powerful nobles down to individual farmers on their own plots granted to them by a local warlord.

A feudal tenure-based system has drawbacks, however. Tenants' loyalty to the sovereign is often conditional, based on complicated webs of mutual obligations and exceptions to the legal code which make it difficult to change or reform the economy. Powerful feudal nobles may defect to an enemy intact to preserve their status in the face of invasion - or even scheme to seize control of the land themselves.

<English>One of the many great inventions of the mid-19th century was 'moving pictures'. By creating a narrow strip of transparent film with tiny still images impressed on it, and rapidly moving this film past a light source, the images could be projected onto a wall or screen. Changing the image fast enough (~10 times per second) creates the illusion of motion, allowing artists to show an audience a moving, lifelike image of events on screen.

This gave rise to the first "mass media." The creation of motion pictures became a professionalized industry, with a special class of artists who were experts at using techniques like camera angles and special effects to evoke emotion. It also created a new class of celebrity - the movie star, who was seen by millions on a regular basis where an ordinary actor would never appear before more than a few thousand people at a time.

Film was not just used for entertainment, it became a powerful medium for education, journalism, and advertising. It also became a popular vehicle for state propaganda.</English>

<English>Finance refers to the organized processes of handling money. While money is an ancient innovation, for most of history currency was handled in simple ways. Coins were just another commodity, fixed volumes of precious metal that had some kind of official sanction. A rich person would simply have large numbers of coins, much as they might have a large herd of cattle or a warehouse full of pottery. Anyone who wanted to buy something would simply pile up coins into a large heap that could be exchanged for the good, usually by earning them a few at a time.

This had limits. Starting a business, making major purchases or engaging in large scale public works were difficult because the buyer needed to have all their money at once, and at the beginning of the process, in order to accomplish anything. Travel was more dangerous because there was no way to store money during travel except on your person. If you needed money at your destination to do business, you would have to carry it with you.

Around 1000 CE solutions to this problem emerged. One obvious solution was the creation of banks - dedicated storehouses that would hold onto money and which could contact other banks in other cities. Instead of traveling with a hundred gold coins on your person, you could deposit the gold in a bank at home, travel to a destination, and 'withdraw' coins from the other city's bank: their records would tell them that you owned the money, but in another place. Banks could also make loans; a large sum of money up-front, to be paid back over a period of time with interest. This allowed the wealthy to invest with more safety and gave the poor an option for buying expensive capital goods.

The rise of financial institutions has come with costs. Professional money-manipulators have a great deal of power in society, and sometimes use it at others' expense. But it greatly increases the economic power and flexibility of a civilization.</English>

<English>In its first centuries, gunpowder was too unstable and metallurgy too crude for the new explosive mix to be used for applications other than demolitions, fireworks, and large, heavily overbuilt artillery pieces. But with advances in metalworking in the 15th and 16th centuries CE, it became possible to create man-portable gunpowder weapons, which began to supplement and then to replace earlier ranged weapons such as the bow, crossbow, and sling.

By the 17th century, the world's most modern armies relied in large part on blocks of musket-armed infantry, often supported by pike units to keep cavalry from running down the musketeers while they reloaded their clumsy weapons. The pike units were removed entirely with the development of the bayonet, and ever since that era infantry combat has been dominated by the role of the gun and advances in firearms technology.

Even though early firearms were little if any deadlier than a good bow on average, they triggered a revolution in warfare. Firearms were easy to learn to use, and incredibly easy to mass produce compared to the cost of a suit of "bullet proof" steel armor. This helped drive the last nails into the coffin of heavily armored shock cavalry in Europe, ended the dominance of nomadic horse-archer cultures in Asia, and triggered a shift towards mass armies recruited from among the populace, ultimately paving the way for the revolutionary leveé en masse of the Napoleonic French.</English>

<English>When an atomic nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei and a spray of single subatomic particles, including neutrons and X-ray photons. Since the impact of a neutron can itself cause a fission reaction, if enough atoms which can undergo fission ("fissile" atoms) are concentrated in the same place, they will begin to spontaneously experience a higher and higher rate of fission. As the concentration increases past a threshold known as "critical mass," the rate of fission becomes so high that a large fraction of the fissile material will undergo fission at once, releasing extremely large amounts of energy, mostly in the form of X-rays.

The discovery of atomic fission in 1938 as a result of chemical assays of uranium samples came during the runup to the largest war in the history of the world. All the major powers of the age were mobilizing the full resources of science and industry to prevail in the coming conflict. Under the circumstances, when theoretical physicists determined that under some conditions fission could be used to make powerful weapons, the development of these weapons became inevitable.

Nuclear weapons rely mainly on fission as a source of massive, instantaneous energy release - fusion or "H-bombs" actually use the fusion stage as a secondary booster, to enhance the efficiency of the fission reaction more than anything else. A nuclear device contains enough fissile material (some uranium isotopes, or plutonium-239) to release trillions of joules of energy, or even quadrillions at the extreme upper limit. This energy, released as X-rays that are absorbed by the device's surroundings, creates a roughly spherical zone of superheated matter called a "nuclear fireball," which is roughly as hot as the interior of the sun. The intensity of light and heat from the fireball is enough to literally blind the unprotected eye, often permanently.

The effects propagate outward in the form of a "blast wave", a zone of high pressure air pushed outward from the blast, which exerts pressures on the order of one atmosphere for a large area around the point where the device is initiated. This blast wave can be powerful enough to destroy reinforced buildings at a range of kilometers, and lightly constructed buildings at a range of many kilometers, depending on the yield of the device. Meanwhile, direct heating from the fireball creates a "thermal pulse" which can cause instant third-degree burns at long distances, and ignite flammable materials, often resulting in numerous and intense fires throughout the area targeted by the device. Close in, the heat is sufficient to fuse large ground areas into a field of glass, subsequently broken up and shattered by the blast.

As this devastation goes on, the fireball from a nuclear initiation in atmosphere will tend to rise, creating the characteristic "mushroom cloud" associated with nuclear weapons in the public imagination. The effects on the ground are large enough to lay waste to entire cities, render troop movements practically impossible, and kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, at a single blow.

Perhaps the most sinister, though far from the most lethal, effect of nuclear weapons is radioactive fallout - fission byproducts from the fissile material in the device, and other matter irradiated during the event. When nuclear weapons are set off high in the atmosphere, fallout is relatively mild, but an initiation close to ground level that sucks up material on the ground into the fireball itself to be irradiated can produce much greater levels of fallout.

Some of this fallout is often redeposited in the form of a deadly black rain near Ground Zero, which is very radioactive and highly lethal. The rest spreads out over a large area downwind of the target. The effects of multiple devises are particularly severe in this respect, as for reasons not yet well understood it is common for intense, lethally radioactive 'hot spots' to appear where the fallout patterns from multiple nuclear initiations interact. While most of the land contaminated by fallout is broadly habitable, hot spots may give lethal doses of radiation in a short time, guaranteeing a slow, painful death from radiation sickness.

All the effects of nuclear attacks are made far worse by the fact that the initiations destroy a great deal of infrastructure and first-response assets, making humanitarian relief extremely difficult. Bringing in supplies and caring for the thousands upon thousands of sick and wounded becomes nearly impossible. Long-term effects can be similarly devastating; a nuclear attack powerful enough to destroy a modern nation's ability to make war will predictably ruin its infrastructure and lead to famines and breakdowns of the civilian economy for years to come.

The creation of a nuclear arsenal is a huge industrial undertaking for even an advanced nation - the original Manhattan Project required 1/6 of all electricity produced in the United States during the war years, and a vast influx of money to build a network of secret industrial facilities to produce fissile material and develop bomb designs.

Production of fissiles takes high-end precision machinery which is available from only a handful of sources in the modern world - monitoring of these tools plays a major part in anti-proliferation efforts today. Designing the devices is also a major challenge, even more difficult if they cannot be tested (today, in underground chambers; in the 1940s and 1950s, often in the open air). A nuclear device which is designed improperly will 'fizzle:' it will undergo only partial fission before the energies released blow the device apart, with most of the fissile material being wasted entirely. This is a particularly common problem with the simplified designs created by various third world nations (see the Pakistani and North Korean nuclear programs for reference).

Once created, nuclear weapons can be delivered by missile, air-dropped bomb, or large caliber artillery shell; some nuclear devices have been built in the one-kiloton range which are small enough to be man-portable have been built, though they are awkward and very bulky. Most war plans featuring nuclear weapons rely on the "nuclear triad" of manned bombers (which are good at fighting their way through defenses, and cheap), ICBMs (which are impossible to stop without specialized anti-ballistic missile defenses, but expensive and impossible to call off after launch), and shorter-ranged submarine-launched ballistic missiles (which, like ICBMs, are very hard to stop, but which have the added advantage of being impossible to destroy in a preemptive strike unless the attacker knows exactly where to find the submarine with the missiles).

Since in a nuclear war the nation's leaders might be killed at any time, nuclear weapons are aimed according to pre-set war plans, with the devices being targeted in what is called a "laydown," with the intent of destroying a specific list of targets as efficiently and thoroughly as possible. Targets for a laydown might include the enemy's nuclear launch facilities, command and control centers, transport facilities vital to military mobilization such as ports, railroad marshalling yards, and highway interchanges, airports that could be used to launch bombers, factories which produce components for advanced weapons, and the offices of government agencies that could organize nuclear war or mobilize civil defense to limit the effects of the nuclear attack.

As a rule, cities are not targeted specifically with the intent of killing vast numbers of people, but since so many of the important targets are in or around cities, any nuclear war is sure to destroy many cities and kill tens of millions of people. Civil defense measures can reduce civilian casualties, but never even come close to eliminating them.

Fortunately for mankind, the terrifying power of nuclear weapons is sobering for any sane or intelligent person. Some claim that the rise of nuclear arsenals among the developed nations has actually reduced the odds of war breaking out, because it would be impossible to attack a nuclear-armed country and defeat it without taking terrible damage from nuclear counterattack. Balanced against this is the fear of accidental war - that weapons prepared to launch a counterattack might be fired by mistake, in response to a false alarm. There is also the risk that if nuclear weapons become common in too many nations, political instability might let them fall into the hands of groups irresponsible and deranged enough to try to use them.

Because of this, many countries have political movements devoted to nuclear disarmament, including well organized protest movements such as the one which has been permanently camped outside the residence of the President of the United States since 1982. These movements have had some success - the large nuclear powers have negotiated repeated reductions of their nuclear arsenals from the peak of the Cold War circa 1970. Certain types of weapons have been banned as 'too provocative,' creating the threat of a successful nuclear sneak attack and thus giving the enemy an incentive to strike first out of fear.

But many nuclear devices remain, and some countries continue to pursue expanded nuclear capabilities, for obvious reasons - it's the ultimate deterrent against ordinary invasion.</English>

		<English>In the early ancient world, armies mostly consisted of militia and levies that were only raised in the event of war. These armies were usually small enough and the ensuing warfare limited enough to be directly commanded by their political leaders.
 
During the Roman Republic and later Empire, armies became increasingly professionalised, especially after the Marian reforms. The large extent of the Roman Empire also made it impractical for their leadership to exercise direct control over the military. Similar developments also took place in the Chinese Han dynasty.
 
This development conferred more military and political power to the generals entrusted with military command. While this made armies more professional and successful, it also led to a different distribution of power. In the Roman Empire, generals were often the decisive factor in choosing the next emperor or disposing of an unsuccessful sitting emperor, contributing to the empires instability. In China, competing military warlords ultimately caused the collapse of the Han dynasty.
 
This sort of political power based on military authority paved the way for the idea of nobility in the feudal sense and the system of feudalism in the Middle Ages.</English>

<English>The word geology comes from Greek, meaning "knowledge of the earth." Throughout history, humans have searched for mineral resources valuable to them; the best flint and obsidian for toolmaking, veins of gold, silver, and gems, the ores of useful metals. The systematic rise of science in the 18th century, and the relaxation of old taboos about the nature and origin of the world, allowed scholars to think more freely about the earth, as about other subjects. These 'geologists' examined rock strata, tectonic activity such as earthquakes and volcanoes, and the patterns formed in the landscape by erosion and other forces of nature.

In doing so, they replaced the old, naive picture of the world as an unchanging mass of rock. Geologists of the 19th and 20th centuries have learned that the ground we stand on is actually a series of plates of stone floating on the sea of lava that makes up most of the Earth's mass. Over the eons ("geologic time") powerful forces slowly reshape the landscape, bringing new rock closer to the surface and rearranging the terrain to form mountains and seas.

Understanding geology helps us understand where to find mineral resources, and how to channel the elemental forces of earth and water to our advantage.</English>

<English>Globalization is the process by which different peoples spread across the world become united by ties of ideology, economics, and politics. The first wave of globalization took place during the 19th century Age of Imperialism, when steam power and telegraphy allowed European empires to spread zones of influence across most of the world, creating a web of transport, communication, and government. However, access to these networks was limited and patchy and many people neither knew nor cared about events in far-off lands.

The World Wars sped up the process. The staggering, apocalyptic scale of combat caught up many colonial possessions in Africa and Asia, permanently undermining European rule at the same time that people in economic backwaters were exposed to a wide variety of modern products and weapons. After World War Two, ideologies such as nationalism or communism spread into regions that had previously been dominated by traditional cultures that were less inclined to resist foreign rule. A wave of "decolonization" swept the world.

But this was not the end. Direct imperial rule of poor nations by rich ones went out of fashion, the economic bonds between rich and poor were not so easily broken. The industrial giants of the developed world could easily produce enough goods to supply massive export markets, while needing to import raw materials on an ever-growing scale as their own supplies of timber, coal, ore, and oil became depleted. Along with these flows of goods came flows of popular products and the culture that came with them, particularly from the United States. Artifacts of American culture (Hollywood movies, blue jeans, Coca-Cola) became world-spanning; to a lesser extent this diffusion worked from other sources, and even worked the other way, with foreign customs being adopted in the former colonial metropoles.

Along with these economic ties came an entangled world political stage. Dictators of small, remote countries could no longer count on isolation and control of the media to keep their people from becoming restless, or to keep large foreign powers from intruding on their business. The only security for small nations was to align themselves with the economic interests of the great power blocs, supplying cheap resources and labor and giving themselves a place in the new world order.

Today the world is extensively globalized, a product of the capitalist triumph of the post-Cold War era. Whether this is socially desirable, economically sustainable, or even ecologically survivable remains to be seen, and is likely to become one of the great questions of the 21st century.</English>

		<English>Heritage is that which, having been created by our ancestors, is given to us because our ancestors willed that it be given to us. The concept of heritage and similar words with the same root such as "inheritance" and "heredity" are fundamental to the human self-image. Nearly everyone feels affectionate bonds to both their ancestors and their descendants. As a result, there is a near-universal desire to make sure that one's descendants inherit the virtues, resources, and opportunities that made one's own successes possible. Conversely, there is a near-universal belief that one is entitled to practice the traditions, use the assets, and partake of the opportunities that one's ancestors enjoyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More broadly, heritage can refer to the collective legacy left behind by the ancestral generations of an entire town, nation, culture, or civilization. This heritage can be material (natural resources cultivated and preserved by past generations), economic (control over property owned by ancestors), aesthetic (works of art that have endured through multiple generations), cultural (practices that protected or enriched the society in the past), or spiritual (the presumed supernatural protection of ancestral spirits, and the idea of following "the faith of one's fathers" as a gesture of unity with that which came before and that which will come in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]How to efficiently preserve one's heritage, to obtain as large a share of its rewards as possible, while passing it down to the next generation in turn, is a preoccupation of most humans and most human societies. Individuals do this with legal procedures such as wills or through the practices of childrearing (intended to instill traditional virtues in the young). Nations fund museums and preservation projects, make laws regarding cultural practices, and sometimes even go to war for the sake of preserving their heritage from that which they perceive to threaten it.</English>

Immense bodies of farming lore arose, about the best practices for growing plants in a given land, under varying conditions of soil conditions, temperature, day length, rainfall, parasites, disease and predation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The careful and professional science of crop-growing played a large role in the pre-industrial Age of Colonialism. Knowing how best to produce staple crops also made it easier to mass-cultivate luxury crops for export. Since most luxury crops grew best in certain climates and soils under the eyes of local populations who knew how to cultivate them (tobacco in the New World, tea in the Far East), this opened up new routes for trade and investment around the world.</English>

		<English>The humanities are the academic disciplines which study human behavior, organization, society, and culture. They include but are not limited to philosophy, history, archaeology, anthropology, theology, classical studies, law, semiotics, linguistics, and the arts. The fields collectively known as the humanities are generally pursued by specialized scholars or artists, who work steadily to refine their aesthetic sense, their understanding of the human condition, and their knowledge of the proper order of human affairs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While it is generally difficult to point to specific physical benefits garnered from these fields, collectively they make up almost all that motivates the human race. Without art, law, religion, history, and philosophy, human civilizations are at a loss as to how to organize themselves or what goals they should orient themselves towards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Individuals may pursue self-gratification or bare survival in the absence of these things, but social cohesion tends to break down rapidly when this is all that people have and share with each other. Thus, the humanities form the mortar, the glue, the nuts and bolts, that hold civilizations together.</English>

People need water to live, to raise crops, to move cargo along rivers, canals, and the sea. As the understanding of water and water pressure became more complete and mathematical in late pre-industrial times, traditional projects of water-manipulation grew more ambitious. Many civilizations built or improved great canals, for instance, making artificial waterways where nature did not provide an easy path. In areas where river valleys posed a flooding hazard, great levees and dikes were built to stem the flow of water. Existing innovations like waterwheels were used on a larger and larger scale, to provide greater reserves of power for manufacturing.</English>

<English>Infrastructure is the collective term for all those facilities and systems by which it is possible for human civilizations to carry out productive enterprises and maintain a functional economy. Examples of infrastructure assets include but are not limited to transportation facilities, electrical power grids, financial systems, water supplies, waste disposal facilities, flood control facilities, lighthouses, telecommunication networks, and arguably systems designed to provide services directly to the public such as education systems, law enforcement, public housing, and state-funded hospitals.

Some types of infrastructure are nearly always created, maintained, and administered by government agencies. Others lend themselves better to privatization. The question of whether infrastructure should be publicly or privately owned is often hotly debated.

The increasingly elaborate nature of infrastructure in advanced, developed societies is one of the main reasons they represent such a vast change in terms of lifestyle and quality of life from pre-industrial times. Industrial-scale projects make it possible to provide basic necessities of life to all citizens with little difficulty, enabling people to concentrate on things other than providing for their sustenance. For instance, a public water system that pipes drinkable water into every home saves a great deal of time and energy compared to requiring every individual to operate their own well, or draw water from a nearby river or lake. It is also possible to make such a water system much healthier and safer than individuals could do alone, and to provide quantities of water that would be an immense laborious undertaking in the absence of the general system of waterworks.

While infrastructure makes us safe and prosperous, however, it can also make us vulnerable. Managing infrastructure with safety and reliability can require complex bureaucracy and confining regulations. And in times of war or natural disaster, large parts of a society's infrastructure may be destroyed, forcing thousands or millions of people to do without essential things which they had never lacked before.</English>

	</TEXT>
	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_INSURANCE_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Insurance is, at its core, a way of managing risk using contracts and the legal system. An insurance policy guarantees to the individual that, in the event that they suffer some sort of defined loss, they will be compensated for the resulting damages. This is widely desired in the modern world because a single accident can cause life-altering, massive consequences for individuals, or even for large organizations. Durable items of property such as complex machines, homes, and workplaces represent the accumulated hard work of years, and can be lost overnight in case of emergency. It is seldom practical for individuals and corporations to store up enough money to replace the losses quickly, so such emergencies can lead to ruin.

Insurance systems operate by collecting small "premiums" of money from a large base of clients, and then pooling this money to use in case a disaster strikes any one of the clients. Since the disasters are generally highly unlikely, spreading the risk of loss and damage among numerous clients can reduce the cost of insurance to a very manageable level. The use of scientific statistical calculations can predict the risk of disaster and allow the insurance provider to tailor their coverage to the individual - those who are deemed 'high risk' typically end up paying larger premiums. This is meant to compensate for the increased danger that the insurer will have to pay to cover the accidents they are likely to suffer.

Insurance is an extremely complex field morally, economically, and legally. Insurance companies often hold onto large sums of money, and by the nature of their business tend to extract considerable profit from the fear of crises, from those who fear illness, injury, or property damage. Insurance contracts can be immensely complicated in an attempt to limit the insurance company's payout in case the client acts in ways they deem improper.

However, insurance is likely to remain a permanent part of civilized life, a direct result of the human desire to reduce the risks of life in a dangerous world - and to replace them with steady, predictable costs of doing business.</English>

<English>Journalism is the profession of investigating and reporting on news of interest to the journalist's readers, listeners, or viewers. Journalism plays an important role in economics and politics, by allowing the masses to access information that would otherwise be available only to a lucky, connected few.

Journalism as we now know it comes from the rise of news corporations (particularly newspapers, in the 19th and 20th centuries), improved transportation and communications that allowed correspondents to move about, learn things, and report back to headquarters quickly, and the rise of mass literacy among the general public in the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the middle and late 20th century the rise of radio and television created new media for journalists to distribute information. At the same time they changed the dynamics of how news flowed through the system, and what sorts of information could be presented, culminating in concepts like the "sound bite" and the "24-hour news cycle." Today, journalism is undergoing a sea change, as the old newspapers struggle to maintain public readership in the age of the internet, while critics argue that the television news have become bland tools for soothing and manipulating the masses instead of informing them. At the same time, vast numbers of enterprising individuals have taken it upon themselves to document and comment on the news online, creating a sphere of private, individualized online journalism.

The relationship between the "fourth estate" of journalists and government power is always uneasy. In dictatorships, state control of the media blurs the line between journalism and propaganda. Even in democratic nations, the organized media may be afraid of losing access to the corridors of power, of political concerns, or of undermining their own positions as wealthy information-handling organizations.</English>

		<English>The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes.
 
Roman law was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated. Although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin legal maxims (called brocards) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Law Merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.
 
As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The Napoleonic and German Codes became the most influential.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_JURISPRUDENCE_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Jurisprudence is the theory of making legal decisions, and is practiced by judges, juries, magistrates, or other individuals or groups that are empowered to determine the right or wrong in matters of law. Jurisprudence can relate to questions about the law in and of itself, such as whether a particular case contradicts some principle enshrined in a particular nation's law. Or it can relate to questions about whether the laws are just and appropriate, and whether they are being appropriately enforced, in light of their social consequences.

Many ancient societies developed bodies of law and particular methods by which a case could be judged according to the law. In many cases the law was supplemented by what is called 'precedent' - the idea that if courts have decided in the past that a certain act is legal or illegal, or that certain responses are appropriate to a certain situation, then those same decisions should be repeated in new cases, rather than changed. Observing precedent has the effect of making law more orderly and predictable, making it easier to be certain whether or not one is obeying the law, and minimizing the risk that a judge will make an inappropriate decision for personal reasons.

Jurisprudence was further developed in the Middle Ages as scholarship spread and legal systems grew more complex. In Renaissance-era Europe, in Islam during the Golden Age, in China during the Tang and later dynasties, and so forth. An immense variety of philosophies of jurisprudence then evolved and continued to flourish, as each society pursued its respective concepts of law and justice, in an attempt to establish a benevolent order throught their lands.</English>

Early labour unions, formed by skilled labourers in specific fields, met with opposition from both employers and the government. In the 19th century, laws were passed legalizing labour unions, and by the 20th century unions were formed in semi- or unskilled fields such as mining, transportation, and dock working. Binding their interests together and bargaining collectively, labour unions forced factory and business owners to provide better working conditions and economic status for their workers.</English>

These groups were ruled by a tribal chieftain, who acted as an advisor, and enforcer of the will of the gods. No formal laws existed in these early cultures, but fear of the gods and a sense of tribal customs and morality kept order in the tribe. As societies became larger and more diverse, the need arose for established rules of conduct. The earliest known codes of laws existed in Babylon, India, and Palestine. The Twelve Tables of Rome, written in 500 BC, and its successors such as the Justinian Code, were the first codes of law to distinguish between public law, which involves the state, and private law, which concerns disputes between citizens. Roman law was the first formalized written system of laws, and went on to influence many of the legal systems of the modern world.</English>

		<English>Leverage is the general principle behind all early mechanisms that rely on mechanical advantage. The six classical simple machines are: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge and screw. 
 
A simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force. Ignoring friction losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. The machine can increase the amount of the output force, at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load. The ratio of the output to the applied force is called the mechanical advantage.
 
Simple machines can be regarded as the elementary "building blocks" of which all more complicated machines (sometimes called "compound machines") are composed. For example, wheels, levers, and pulleys are all used in the mechanism of a bicycle. The mechanical advantage of a compound machine is just the product of the mechanical advantages of the simple machines of which it is composed.
 
The idea of a simple machine originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. He discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage.</English>

<English>Logistics is the art of producing, moving, storing, controlling, and distributing supplies, in order to carry out a large project, especially in war. Logistics has governed the conduct of armies since ancient times.

Ancient historians often recount the use of vast armies of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, in great campaigns. This is generally deemed unlikely, entirely because of logistics. To set great masses of people to work, one must have plenty of food and other goods, and ways to move them. For domestic labor this is relatively easy, since grain and supplies can be stockpiled near a fixed workplace and used as necessary. But in war, the supplies have to be transported and guarded from enemy raiders.

Human porters, pack animals, and animal-drawn wagons have limits; all these forms of transport have to eat and are vulnerable to exhaustion. Past a certain distance, the weight of food a man or animal carries to feed themself is so great that there's no room to transport anything else. Smaller armies can survive by hunting, foraging, and (most often) stealing the food of the local populace. But a large enough army will strip the land bare and potentially drink rivers dry; without a better means of supply the army will die of thirst or hunger even if it never sees an armed enemy.

In ancient times (and even today) the cheapest, most cost-effective way of moving bulk cargo was by sea. Even an ancient ship could carry many tons of cargo, much faster than man or beast could walk. Therefore, large ancient armies were tied to the seas and rivers; traveling any great distance from water was very risky.  This constraint remained throughout pre-industrial history, although areas with strong governments that built good roads could simplify the problem by allowing land transport to move faster and carry more; the Roman and Inca empires both thrived because they built excellent road networks throughout their land, and used them to move large armies.

In modern times, logistics has become more demanding, but more powerful. Railroads and modern ships carry totally unprecedented weights of cargo at incredible speed. But industrial armies demand tons upon tons of fuel, artillery, ammunition, spare parts, and other goods not needed by an ancient army. Logistics is no less important than it ever was, whether the goods move by sea, railway, highway, or even through the air.

A cunning enemy may always strike at an army's logistics. This has caused countless defeats throughout history, from the Horns of Hattin to the jungles of Dien Bien Phu. Therefore, much of what we call generalship revolves around making sure one's own logistics are secure, giving one the advantages of well fed troops with plenty of weapons - and denying those advantages to the enemy.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_MACROECONOMICS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Macroeconomics is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. This includes national, regional, and global economies. Macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, and the interrelations among the different sectors of the economy to better understand how the whole economy functions. Macroeconomists develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment, international trade and international finance.
 
Macroeconomic theory has its origins in the study of business cycles and monetary theory. In general, early theorists believed monetary factors could not affect real factors such as real output. John Maynard Keynes attacked some of these "classical" theories and produced a general theory that described the whole economy in terms of aggregates rather than individual, microeconomic parts. Attempting to explain unemployment and recessions, he noticed the tendency for people and businesses to hoard cash and avoid investment during a recession. He argued that this invalidated the assumptions of classical economists who thought that markets always clear, leaving no surplus of goods and no willing labor left idle.</English>

<English>Marketing is the practice of persuading people that an object, idea, or behavior is desirable (and worth paying for). Marketing has existed in some form since prehistoric times; one may speculate that the first marketing activities were invented within five minutes of the first invention of commerce.  The development of mass media such as broadcast radio, print journalism, and film made it possible to market on a larger scale. The rise of a working and middle class in developed societies with enough disposable income to buy luxury goods made it desirable to do so. The growth of modern industrial corporations that could produce goods in immense quantities made it necessary to do so.

Common practices in modern marketing include direct personal approaches, flattery of the customer, praise of the product (intellectually honest or otherwise), and efforts to make the seller appear sympathetic and likeable to the prospective buyer. The main difference is that all these things are now transmitted from the individual advertiser to the mass of the population through new communications technology such as printing, broadcasts, or the Internet.

The practice of marketing is often criticized for dishonesty, for misleading people into paying for that which is useless to them, for encouraging people to go into debt, and for discouraging people from thrift and from building up savings for the future. It is also criticized for the increasingly intrusive way in which, in the modern computerized era, marketers use "big data" to analyze individuals' purchasing habits and tailor advertisements to them. This is widely regarded as intrusive, and as having ominous implications for the individual's privacy and control over their own life in the future.</English>

		<English>Healthcare is the practice of acting so as to preserve or restore the health of the individual patient, although this is normally construed to not include basic sustenance needs such as air, water, and food. Healthcare can be divided into a wide range of overlapping categories. These include but are not limited to preventative care (to maintain health through nutrition, exercise, and hygiene), palliative care (to relieve the symptoms of a patient who cannot be cured by the available means), outpatient care (where the patient is able to function and live independently while undergoing treatment), urgent care (treatment of pressing medical problems that are nonetheless not life-threatening), and acute care (where a patient requires detailed monitoring or complex medical support and so must remain in a hospital with physicians in attendance).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since it affects what may be the foremost concern of nearly all humans - their health - health care occupies a large share of the total time and energy of the human race. Many (though not all) of the professionals involved in providing health care receive unusual prestige and wealth within their own societies. This was the case even in ancient times when the practice of medicine was primitive to the point of being life-threatening.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In modern times, the health care system has become an elaborate and refined infrastructure, especially in developed nations. Not only is it an industry in its own right, it supports various other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry. The challenge of working out how to efficiently pay for this vast system that keeps us alive and relatively comfortable is a subject of energetic debate in many societies.</English>

		<English>A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets, hardens and adheres to other materials, binding them together. Cement is seldom used solely, but is used to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement is used with fine aggregate to produce mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel aggregates to produce concrete.
 
Lime was used on Crete and by the ancient Greeks. It is uncertain where it was first discovered that a combination of hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture, but concrete made from such mixtures was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers.
 
In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.</English>

<English>Metallurgy is the study of the properties of metals and the methods used to separate metal deposits from metal-bearing ores. Through the course of history, artisans have switched the materials from which they constructed weapons and tools to harder, more durable metals as they were discovered. Constant improvements in metallurgy led to the discovery of new metals and alloys that were stronger, lighter, and cheaper.

By the late 19th century, metallurgy was a sophisticated science. The rise of modern chemistry led to the discovery of a vast number of 'new' chemical elements that could be used in alloys, and electric power made it possible to control the conditions under which metals were worked more finely than ever before. Metallurgists developed a vast array of new kinds of steel and other alloys, with different combinations of hardness, flexibility, corrosion-resistance, and other properties. These rapid advances in metallurgy had vast implications for almost every field of engineering.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_NANOTECHNOLOGY_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Nanotechnology is the craft of creating molecular 'machinery' to perform customized chemical and biological operations at a very small scale.

Up through the 20th century, the sciences of chemistry and medicine relied on naturally occuring substances, or large-scale manipulation and processing of those substances, to produce what was needed. Chemicals might be mixed in a vat and heated up, or exposed to some other substance or condition, but there was no direct interaction between the human operator and the molecules themselves: they are simply left to act in accordance to blind forces that affect every part of the material at once.

The idea of nanotechnology or 'nanotech,' pioneered by figures like Eric Drexler of MIT, is that we can create complex molecules which act like tiny machine tools. These molecular tools would have identifiable parts like tiny levers, wheels, and 'grippers' made up of varying structures of single atoms. They could then grab hold of a material surface or molecules floating in a solution, and break them up or reassemble them as needed.

This would have many applications. Nanotech could be used to 'build' materials with unusual or extreme properties atom by atom, to clean up dangerous chemicals, or to enter into the body and attack cancer cells or toxins. Advocates expect them to perform all manner of tasks which cannot be achieved by simpler, conventional means of industrial chemistry.

One example of successful, naturally-occuring 'nanotech' is the use of biological enzymes in industrial chemistry. An enzyme can take a chemical reaction that would normally happen slowly or not at all (like sugar turning into alcohol in a fermented beverage) and greatly speed it up. Nanotechnology researchers hope to take the potential of natural enzymes and generalize them to do whatever we can imagine, by controlling the molecular structure of matter.

Some say nanotechnology will totally revolutionize the production of goods and distribution of resources around the world. Others question this, pointing out that nanotech molecular machines will be inherently large, relatively fragile molecules that may not survive well outside a controlled environment. It is also uncertain whether nanotech would ever be more efficient than 'macro-scale' processes for making large objects: nanotech could be a good way to apply a coating to an engine part, but not such a good way to make the part in the first place.

Still, it seems likely that 21st century chemistry and biochemistry will be greatly strengthened by advances in this field, even if industry and society as a whole are not changed so much.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_NOBILITY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Nobility can refer to "the nobility," a class of aristocrats who inherit the right to dominate society at large. Or it can refer to the ideals of "noble" behavior, as favored by this class.

Aristocratic elites have been with human civilization for millenia. Any person with enough resources, political influence, or military power would have a great advantage in controlling others, and could use that control to further preserve their power. Naturally, anyone blessed by such a fortunate combination of power and wealth would want to pass it on to their children, so legal systems emerged to make sure that the titles and positions of nobility would be inherited safely.

The most common employment for aristocrats in history has been warfare. The nobility can be sure of getting plenty of food and good living conditions, so that their children grow up big and strong. They can afford expensive, carefully crafted weapons like suits of armor, high-quality bows, and fine warhorses. And their political power meant they could easily recruit fighting men from among the people they controlled, making sure they'd have trustworthy retainers to watch their back and handle the supplies while the nobles themselves went off to fight.

The ideal of military courage and self-discipline therefore plays a great role in the idea of "nobility." A nobleman is normally expected to be brave in battle, to be prepared to fight either to defend his own interests or the interests of his ruler, and to act in the ways that his society expects of warriors.

Noblewomen generally were not expected to fight; for females nobility had relatively fewer attractions, except of course for the freedom it granted from drudge labor like grinding grain or tending crops.</English>

<English>The greatest peacetime use of the power of the atomic nucleus is in nuclear reactors. In the early days after the discovery of atomic fission, this was a subject of great hope and optimism - the ideal was expressed that atomic energy would make electricity "too cheap to meter".

A nuclear reactor consists of a number of 'fuel rods' or 'fuel pellets' made up of fissile materials, kept at a concentration below that needed for a critical mass. Thus, the chain reaction cannot run away as in a nuclear bomb, and simply keeps the fuel running at a high temperature, steadily heated by rapid fission of the uranium. The heat is used to power turbines through a variety of media- pressurized water, steam, or liquid sodium, for instance; the turbines power electric generators.

Design of a nuclear reactor is extremely challenging. The radiation environment inside the reactor core is intense, and all substances used inside the reactor must be chosen with an eye to their resistance and behavior when faced with radioactive bombardment of neutrons. Beyond this, there are also safety concerns- a nuclear reactor contains enough radioactive materials to contaminate a large area, if those materials were spread across the landscape.

Early plant designs, dating to the 1950s, often had serious safety problems associated with the designs. Since then, the nuclear industry has learned much, but its tracks are dogged by anti-nuclear advocates opposed to the use of nuclear energy. This opposition points to nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima and questions whether modern plants are truly safe from such disasters; they also object to the fact that nuclear reactors generate radioactive waste which remains dangerous to human life for thousands of years and must be stored under special conditions.

Supporters of nuclear energy reply that there are viable ways to store the waste safely, but the controversy continues to rage. The dream of power "too cheap to meter" has foundered on this, along with a host of practical issues that come with designing the heavily reinforced, disaster-resistant facilities required for the reactor and its wastes.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_OPTICS_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Optics are instruments that manipulate visible light. The basis of optics as we know it comes from medieval times and the European Renaissance. Geometric studies of how light interacted with reflecting surfaces, and with materials like water and glass, were pioneered by the ancient Greeks and the Islamic natural philosophers. In the 1600s, European craftsmen combined this knowledge with improved methods of glassworking to create the first lenses.

A lens is a carefully shaped, transparent object that bends light in predictable ways. Using the right mathematics we can tailor lenses to bend light so that far-away objects seem close by, so that tiny objects are enlarged, or so that blurry objects come into sharp focus. These three applications spawned three major classes of practical optics in the 16th and 17th centuries: the telescope, the microscope, and eyeglasses.

Eyeglasses were of course a practical boon to literacy and the aging eyesight of the average master craftsman or clerk. The telescope and microscope both caused great changes in science, by making visible that which could literally never have been seen before - the details of the solar system and the structure of living tissue.

At the same time the telescope in particular had nautical and military applications. On the sea, lines of sight are long, especially from the top of a mast; having a tool to make an object ten miles away appear as though it is only one mile away lets sailors take full advantage of this. At war, being able to make a detailed observation of enemy positions while staying comfortably out of range of enemy guns was a great thing for scouts and commanders trying to understand how to fight an enemy more effectively.</English>

<English>Pastoralism is a term for the art of raising livestock. It is also used in sociology, to describe a way of life that revolves around herding and caring for domestic animals. Pastoral societies are generally most successful on poorly productive land such as large, dry stretches of desert, savannah, hills, or tundra. In this sort of terrain, dense stands of food crops cannot be grown naturally, so farming is impossible without modern irrigation. However, in such biomes there is a substantial natural supply of grasses and shrubs; humans cannot eat them, but sheep, cattle, goats, or yaks can.

It is often but not always the case that a pastoral people 'follows their herds,' moving from one part of the land they occupy to another to ensure that they have access to the best available grazing, water supplies, and a healthy climate for their animals.

Pastoral societies present a common alternative to agricultural societies, and were capable of functioning and thriving on equal terms with them up until the rise of modern technology. They could be particularly effective in warfare, especially when leaders took advantage of their self-sufficient, highly mobile lifestyle to create an army of self-sufficient, highly mobile soldiers. In modern times, however, the inability of small pastoral communities to manufacture modern weapons, coupled with overpopulation problems, have made it less sustainable and practical for these peoples to live in their traditional mode.</English>

<English>Patronage is the practice of a wealthy or powerful individual choosing to support an artist, charitable organization, scholar, or other worthy cause. This support generally takes the form of donations of money or the exercise of political influence. Patronage is vital to the survival of the arts, even in the modern era when artists can at least occasionally rely on state grants to support their activities - which arguably is itself a form of patronage.

In the medieval and renaissance eras, in particular, the patronage of aristocrats, wealthy merchants, and even kings and emperors had major consequences for the evolution of human knowledge.
Emperors and merchant princes funded great voyages of discovery that traveled across continents. Kings and queens adopted radical philosophers into their courts, giving the philosophers the security they needed to publish ideas about human nature, ethics, and political theory.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_PHOTOGRAPHY_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Photography is the practice of using artifical tools to capture visual images in a durable form. Photography relies on optical devices (usually lenses) to focus incoming light onto a light-sensitive surface, which is then altered by the light so that the effect of the light on the surface can be stored for later reference.

Experiments with photography began around 1800 with efforts to capture images created in a camera obscura (pinhole camera) using light-sensitive chemicals. These efforts began to bear fruit in the 1820s with the development of the photographic plate. Early photography required that the photograph be exposed to the image it was meant to record for a period of hours, making it impractical for any purpose other than taking pictures of landscapes or buildings. By the late 1830s, Louis Daguerre had refined the process until the exposure time had fallen to ten minutes, making it practical for an individual person to be photographed. In 1839, the French government presented Daguerre's method, "open source," as a gift of France to the world.

Meanwhile, other experimentalists worked on promising avenues, such as the creation of photographic 'film' which would form a 'negative,' reversed version of the image (light parts would be dark and vice versa). Further advances in making photographs durable, reproducible, and quick-exposing continued throughout the 19th century.

Around 1900, Eastman and Kodak introduced photographic film - a flexible roll of material that could be used as a backing for light-sensitive chemicals in the camera, removing the need for large, fragile glass photographic plates. Film replaced plates for almost all types of photography other than scientific applications. (Glass plate photography revolutionized astronomy, for instance, by allowing astronomers to record observations or gather up all the light coming to their telescope from the same star onto a single plate for an hours-long exposure).

Color photography, meanwhile, had been practiced as early as the 1860s based on improved scientific understanding of light. However, it was impractical for normal applications until the mid-20th century, representing a further advance over the previously monochrome photos of the era. By the 1970s and '80s, the art of photography had largely stabilized on the standard of film cameras capable of imaging multiple colors on the same piece of film, which would then be "developed" in a laboratory using special chemicals to stabilize and desensitize the film. The resulting film would then form 'negatives' from which accurate reproductions of the original image could be reconstructed.

However, photography was once again revolutionized by the rise of electronic 'digital' cameras. Today, digital cameras that electronically detect light and send the resulting images into digital storage have largely replaced chemical film. Digital cameras have the advantages of requiring no development, storing nigh-unlimited numbers of photos, and being so easily miniaturized that they can be casually attached to a device the size of a pack of cards, as a cheap extra feature.</English>

<English>Pneumatics is the art of using pressurized air or gas as the basis for working machinery. Pneumatics are made practical by the efficient use of metalworking (to create airtight pipes) and organic chemistry (to create glues, resins, and other substances that can form an airtight seal over cloth or other more flexible substances).

Among the advantages of pneumatics are that for many pneumatic systems, the working gas is freely available and nontoxic- to wit, air. Other working gases such as carbon dioxide do present toxicity or asphyxiation hazards, but in exchange tend to allow higher performance. Pneumatic systems tend to be rugged, reliable, and safe due to their being subject to minimal levels of shock from the easily compressed gases acting as a 'cushion'.

Applications include brakes, drills, motors, control systems for ventilating structures, musical instruments, automatic tools such as jackhammers, and automatically-reloading firearms.</English>

<English>Politics, from the Greek for "of or pertaining to citizens," is the practice of influencing people, particularly with the aim of acquiring and using power within a government. The tactics and techniques of politics vary depending on the society. In autocratic societies, the key to political success is the personal appeal to the leader and their most trusted subordinates, along with efforts to undermine rivals and make them appear to be threats to the system. In democracies, a massive range of tools and methods are used to appeal to the general public and acquire their support. Likewise, practitioners of politics in democracies also seek to undermine their opponents, generally attacking their popularity - by means both fair and foul.

The framework that determines what political methods are allowed in a given society can be viewed as a political 'system.' For example, long-established parliamentary democracies have a system that makes violent overthrow of the government unacceptable, such that even if such a coup succeeded, it is likely that the victorious military leader would have difficulty persuading the public to obey orders. Conversely, autocratic systems generally prohibit any form of politics that would involve organizing the masses to express disapproval of state policy.

Formal theorizing on politics dates back to the time of figures such as Plato and Confucius, and represents a major transition in the history of human civilization- because it represents serious, intellectual reflection on the question "how best shall we organize ourselves?"</English>

		<English>Power projection (or force projection) is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state to apply all or some of its elements of national power - political, economic, informational, or military - to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability.
		
This ability is a crucial element of a state's power in international relations. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have some level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable hard power assets (such as a large standing army) may only be able to exert limited regional influence so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the logistical difficulties inherent in the deployment and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.
 
The aircraft carrier strike group, strategic bomber, ballistic missile submarine, and strategic airlifter are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be light and mobile, such as airborne forces (paratroopers and air assault forces) and amphibious assault forces, are utilized in power projection. Forward basing is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located military bases outside a country's territory, reduces the time and distance needed to mobilize them.</English>

<English>The principle behind printing is not very complicated, but immense amounts of complexity are invested in the mass production of printed documents. Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, the early printing presses used a flat tray of inked type. Once paper was placed over the type, a surface was applied and the ink was pressed into the paper. While an improvement over the traditional duplication methods of the time (meticulous hand-scribing of volumes), it was a slow and tedious process to use. Around 1800 the first cylinder press was created, followed by the large and immensely fast rotary presses.

Today, computers have taken this ancient art out of the craftsman's workshop and placed it on the desktop. Desktop publishing revolutionized the creation of printed documents, not only from the standpoint of speed and accuracy, but also by enabling anyone to mass-produce the printed word without investing the many years it takes to learn the trade.</English>

<English>Property refers to the concept that a certain object, idea, or place is solely under the authority of some specific person or entity, and is not available for the use of others without the consent of that 'owner.' The most basic Neolithic societies known to us usually have concepts of individual ownership of certain items, such as tools and caches of food. This is often combined with widespread sharing of the goods, usually done for purposes of reinforcing social ties.

Such a practice results in very cohesive societies. However, such societies often have difficulty organizing their surplus resources to commit to large-scale projects not of immediate use to any one person (such as infrastructure, ceremonial architecture, or military expeditions). Moreover, the system tends to break down in the presence of large numbers of strangers, because it relies on individuals being willing to freely share their belongings with each other. For both these reasons, the rise of cities generally went hand-in-hand with the rise of accumulated property in the hands of social elites, a trend which has persisted throughout recorded history to the present day.</English>

<English>Radar is a method of using radio waves to observe one's surroundings by technological means. Derived from the acronym "RAdio Detection And Ranging," radar permits observation to continue at distances the naked eye cannot reach, in conditions of bad weather and darkness the eye cannot penetrate, with machine-like precision the eye cannot duplicate. It is particularly useful for detecting aircraft at long range, although it can also be used from an aircraft to survey the land, or from a ship to detect another ship at sea.

Innovation in radar technology began shortly before the Second World War, with Britain in the lead and other nations such as Germany and the US following close behind. The British capitalized on their advantage and developed the highly effective "Chain Home" system of early warning stations to detect any enemy aircraft trying to attack their island. This proved a very useful defensive asset in resisting the severe German air attacks of 'the Blitz' during late 1940. Combined with other uses of the radio spectrum (such as cunningly mimicking German navigation beacons so that German bombers would get lost in the dark and bomb random wheat fields instead of British cities), Britain used its advantage in radar to wage what Winston Churchill called a "wizards' war" that complemented the air war then being fought.

When the tables began to turn in 1943, the Germans too found radar a useful means of defending against British and American air attack, although the sheer mass of the Allied war machine caused their defenses to break down by late 1944. Meanwhile, the Germans' submarine warfare campaign likewise suffered from Allied use of radar to detect submarines; and on the other side of the world, the total lack of effective radar on the part of their allies, the Japanese, played a major role in Japan's defeat in air and naval combat from 1942 on.

Radar became far more advanced and developed in the postwar era with the steady rise of electronics technology, especially after the vacuum tube gave way to the integrated circuit. The military continues to make use of radar imaging as the primary means of tracking aircraft, and also employs it to scan the ground from the air. In civilian applications, radar is used to coordinate commercial air traffic to prevent collisions, and is a common, valuable scientific instrument whenever detailed imagery needs to be taken from a distance.</English>

		<English>When the demand for oil-based fuels for lighting and other purposes began to soar in the 19th century, scientists began searching for a way to make use of crude oil. This research led to techniques in which crude oil was broken down, or refined, into a number of different fuels, including kerosene and gasoline. As consumer demand continued to increase, commercial refineries were set up to purify crude oil. The new petroleum products produced as a result of the development and perfection of the refining process led to the use of oil-based fuels in many consumer and industrial applications. These include the use of petrol to power automobiles, and the use of oil for heating and for the generation of electrical power.</English>

<English>Renewable energy is a term used in industry to refer to methods of generating electrical power that can be 'renewed' indefinitely, rather than relying on some supply of fuel that will run out in the foreseeable future. We can predict that at some future time the world's reserves of uranium, natural gas, coal, and (especially) oil will run out. Or, more accurately, there will come a time at which it becomes economically impractical to extract the remaining supply of these materials, due to the extreme cost of doing so.

By contrast, other sources of power are likely to go on indefinitely. Geothermal power is driven by slow radioactive decay inside the earth, tidal power by the gravitational strength of the moon, and solar power is driven by the sun. All three sources of energy will exist as long as our solar system remains in some recognizable form. Likewise, wind and hydroelectric power take advantage of the Earth's naturally occurring water and air cycles, and are driven by its weather; they will exist so long as there is weather to draw power from.

Through the 20th century, renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric energy usually went relatively undeveloped. In some cases this was because of the need for computerized design and coordination to make the systems effective (especially for wind power); in others, it was purely a matter of economics, with power from expendable fuel being cheaper and easier to supply. However, in recent times, many nations have seen fit to explore renewable energy. The hope is that renewable power sources will provide lower environmental impact and longer-term, more sustainable energy into the indefinite future, after other sources of power are exhausted.</English>

	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_REPRESENTATION_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Representation is the practice of having one person stand in for the interests of another person, or of many people. In the context of politics, a government official can be said to 'represent' a 'constituency' who select that official, support them, and hold them accountable for the government's actions. This is a feature of democratic governments.

Representative democracy began to evolve in ancient Athens and Rome. The working-class Roman plebeians, in particular, played a major role in creating the concept. In the 490s BC, the plebeians went on a mass strike and refusing to do any more labor until the elite patrician class created the office of the "plebeian tribune." The tribunes were elected by the plebeians to protect their interests from the relatively wealthy and powerful patricians. Toward this end, the tribunes were empowered to block any action taken by the Senate, which was called "veto" from the Latin for "I forbid." Likewise, they were legally sacrosanct and any person who so much as touched a tribune or interfered with their duty in any way could be put to death.

This idea, that the masses could vote not only on policy issues but on the creation of officials to protect their interests and govern the state on their behalf, remained largely dormant in Western society until the rise of the commercial republics of the late Middle Ages. After that time it began to flourish during the Enlightenment era, for a simple reason. Direct democracy, in which all citizens vote on all actions taken by the state, becomes impossibly unwieldy when the state contains more than, at most, about ten thousand citizens. It is also impractical if the citizenry is spread over a large area so that it cannot meet regularly. For a republic that is several days' travel across, or which has many thousands of voters, to function, representation becomes vital.

The first large European state to employ representative democracy in a significant way was England. The English parliament, which originated as a means for the king to gather the representatives of the populace to hear his wishes and agree on ways to fund his plans, slowly evolved into a body which held the "purse strings" of the entire English government. Ultimately, kings became unable to run their government without Parliament's approval. The efforts of Charles I to do so in the 1630s and 1640s led ultimately to the English Civil War, and to Charles I's execution by beheading.

Thus, representative democracy became established as an alternative to, and potentially an antagonist toward, the notion of the 'divine right of kings' then dominant in continental Europe. This conflict between monarchy and democracy was resolved amicably in England after the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688, which created a constitutional monarchy headed by a reasonably popular king- and one who knew not to overstep the limits of what the people would tolerate.

To this day, this pattern of conflict between representative bodies (legislatures and elected executive officials) and unelected autocrats is a persistent one throughout the world.</English>

These tribesmen used their superior mobility and speed to overwhelm the proto-civilizations just rising in southeast Europe and the Middle East. In approximately 2000 BCE, domestic horses were introduced into Mesopotamia. Within the next several centuries, horses had spread throughout much of Europe and northern Africa. It was not long before nearly every civilization had put horses to work as field animals and as a means of transportation. Horses also went on to play an important role in the military conflicts of nearly every civilization in the world, both as mounts for horsemen and cavalry, and as draft animals for pulling war chariots and heavy weapons into battle.</English>

		<English>The scholarly method or scholarship is the body of principles and practices used by scholars to make their claims about the world as valid and trustworthy as possible, and to make them known to the scholarly public. It is the methods that systemically advance the teaching, research, and practice of a given scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is noted by its significance to its particular profession, and is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is peer-reviewed through various methods.
 
Originally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval theology, scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on dialectical reasoning. The primary purpose of scholasticism is to find the answer to a question or to resolve a contradiction. It was once well known for its application in medieval theology but was eventually applied to classical philosophy and many other fields of study.</English>

<English>Seafaring is the art of directing, maintaining, and preserving ships that travel across the ocean. The earliest human vessels such as rafts, small canoes, and reed boats would have been extremely unsafe on the open ocean. However, there is extensive evidence for the practice of seafaring stretching back to the Bronze Age, or the Neolithic in the case of Polynesian long-distance sailing canoes.

In general, successful seafarers must make use of some source of power other than their own muscles (in the early days of navigation, a sail) to ensure they were not trapped by ocean currents. They must know how to construct reasonably sturdy craft that would resist ocean waves. They had to make use of a great knowledge of weather conditions to ensure the craft was not caught by a storm too powerful to be survived - which in premodern times weather could be predicted only by experience.

All this represented a significant advance over the earliest Stone Age boats and their operations... and yet, all these things were necessary in order for coastal civilizations to make any serious use of maritime travel for trade or exploration.</English>

<English>Shipbuilding is the art of constructing large watergoing vessels for travel on large bodies of water.As the demand for larger, safer vessels to cross the oceans of the ancient world grew, so did knowledge of ship construction. By far the preferred method for building such ships was to make them out of wood - preferably the hardest, strongest timber available, even if this had to be imported over long distances. Great strides in the art of carpentry made it possible to assemble large ships that would be strong enough to withstand the forces of the sea, but flexible enough not to break under heavy impact.

Larger, heavier ships were generally more useful for trade because they could carry a greater volume of goods. They were also more useful for warfare. Ancient naval war revolved around deliberate ramming attacks, boarding parties and sailors firing musclepowered missile weapons at each other. A larger ship would be harder to damage by ramming, would have the tactical advantage of being 'the high ground' in combat, and could carry a larger army with which to capture enemy ships.

Ongoing advances in shipbuilding continued steadily from the Bronze Age up to the present day in many parts of the world. Nations which enjoyed an advantage in the art at any particular time were usually able to dominate the seas for vast distances around their homeland.</English>

		<English>In the high and late middle ages, increase in agricultural production meant there was an excess of additional population. These people gravitated to urban centers, leading to a degree of urbanisation not seen in Europe since the collapse of the Roman Empire.
 
Within these often fortified cities, a new class of people developed. These so called burghers often engaged in trade and commerce and began to accrue wealth independent of the nobility. As these trends continued, cities began to assert their newfound powers to gain additional privileges.
 
This put them in opposition to the traditional feudal power structure. Where central power was weak and cities were affluent, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Northern Italy, cities were successful in defending their sovereignty from feudal overlords. Their success can be linked both to their organisation in regional leagues and alliances as well as innovative military organisation relying on mercenary companies, paving the way to professionalised armies.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_SMELTING_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main use is to produce a base metal from its ore. This includes production of silver, iron, copper and other base metals from their ores. Smelting makes use of heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving just the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, or in earlier times charcoal.
 
The carbon (or carbon monoxide derived from it) removes oxygen from the ore, leaving behind the elemental metal. The carbon is thus oxidized in two stages, producing first carbon monoxide and then carbon dioxide. As most ores are impure, it is often necessary to use flux, such as limestone, to remove the accompanying rock gangue as slag.
 
In the Old World, the first metals smelted were tin and lead. After tin and lead, the next metal to be smelted appears to have been copper. How the discovery came about is a matter of much debate. Campfires are about 200 °C short of the temperature needed for that, so it has been conjectured that the first smelting of copper may have been achieved in pottery kilns. The development of copper smelting in the Andes, which is believed to have occurred independently of that in the Old World, may have occurred in the same way.
 
The discovery of copper manufacture had a significant impact on the history of the Old World. Metals were hard enough to make weapons that were heavier, stronger, and more resistant to impact-related damage than their wood, bone, or stone equivalents.</English>

		<English>Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a "social science". The social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.
 
Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining the quantitative and qualitative researchs). The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.
 
The history of the social sciences begins in the Age of Enlightenment after 1650, which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.</English>

		<English>A social or public service is a service which is provided by government to people living within its jurisdiction, either directly (through the public sector) or by financing provision of services. The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through democratic elections) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of income, physical ability or mental acuity. Even where public services are neither publicly provided nor publicly financed, for social and political reasons they are usually subject to regulation going beyond that applying to most economic sectors. Public policy when made in the public's interest and motivations can provide public services. Public service is also a course that can be studied at a college or university. Examples of public services are the fire brigade, police, air force, and paramedics.
 
A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a public good (being non-rivalrous and non-excludable), but most are services which may (according to prevailing social norms) be under-provided by the market. In most cases public services are services, i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of goods. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are natural monopolies.
 
Historically, the widespread provision of public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the municipal development of gas and water services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as electricity and healthcare. In most developed countries such services are still provided by local or national government, the biggest exceptions being the U.S. and the UK, where private provision is more significant.</English>

In less than a year, the United States had also launched a satellite, Explorer 1. This started the "space race", years of competition between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to achieve new frontiers in space exploration. Space flight advanced rapidly from the simple sub-orbital flights of the 1950s, to manned missions to Earth's moon in the late 1960s. The rapid growth of space technology led to many practical applications, such as weather and surveillance satellites, and vastly improved worldwide communications.

In the Middle Ages, states were usually administered by feudal rulers who attained their position through birthright, so their approach to administration was mostly guided by tradition and personal experience
 
The increasing centralisation and bureaucracy of the early modern state meant that rulers increasingly relied on government officials like governors and diplomats. The highest of these officials formed the cabinet or council of their monarch.
 
Internally, this meant that the state was much more effective in accomplishing its goals, such as levying taxes, enforcing laws and raising armies. It also revolutionised international relations. States would transition to maintain ongoing diplomatic contacts and formalise their relationship through a series of treaties.</English>

<English>The iron alloys produced up until about the 14th century were made by heating a mixture of iron ore and charcoal in a forge, then pounding the molten metal to drive out the impurities or "slag". Occasionally, the iron mixture would absorb more carbon, creating steel rather than wrought iron. Because steel proved to be less brittle and more resistant to corrosion than iron, techniques were developed to produce steel. This was done by blowing a coal derivative called coke through molten iron. Most modern steel making utilizes the "blast furnace", developed by Henry Bessemer in 1855, to accomplish this task on a large-scale basis. The strength and other qualities of steel make it the material of choice for warships, planes, and many other vehicles.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_SUPERCONDUCTORS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911, in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.
 
The electrical resistance of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary conductors, such as copper or silver, this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near absolute zero, a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor; the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An electric current flowing through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.
 
Superconducting magnets are some of the most powerful electromagnets known. They are used in MRI/NMR machines, mass spectrometers, the beam-steering magnets used in particle accelerators and plasma confining magnets in some tokamaks. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the pigment industries.

In the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using cryotron switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make digital circuits based on rapid single flux quantum technology and RF and microwave filters for mobile phone base stations.</English>

In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
 
Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.
 
Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some-especially clinical and counseling psychologists-at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy.</English>

<English>Leather is a hard-wearing, flexible material created by curing and drying animal skins. Forms of leather can be made using Stone Age technology (curing hides with materials like lime or animal brains), or more complex chemical processes. Leather has been in use since at least the second millenium BC, as proven by finds of leather samples over 3000 years old in archaeological digs. Since leather does not last forever under normal conditions, its invention very probably came earlier.

Leather can be made from the skin of almost any large animal, with a variety of qualities. Depending on how it is tanned, it can be flexible or stiff, soft or rough. It is generally waterproof, fairly effective at keeping in heat, and resistant to rotting or decay. Properly oiled and maintained, it can survive desert sandstorms or frozen tundra conditions. It can even be boiled for hardness and used as a form of cheap, lightweight armor protection.

Unlike other fabrics such as linen, cotton, and silk, leather can be made even by nomadic cultures. If the nomads kill a domestic or wild animal, and have a suitable tanning process. On the other hand, leather remains useful in farming societies, especially those with large herd animals such as cattle.

Because it is sturdy and cannot be unraveled like normal cloth, leather can be decorated with a variety of hole-punches, stitches, and decorative studs. Decorative leather goods are a popular form of arts and crafts in many societies. Today, advances in synthetic plastics have made leather less important, and it has now become more of a fashion statement and luxury good than a major fabric in practical use.</English>

		<English>The value of computers increases sharply when they can be used to send information by remote access over long distances. An isolated computer is just a machine for doing calculations and controlling fixed installations. A computer network can coordinate the activities of a large organization, give all members of the group access to a single central database, or allow scattered groups of people to interact in ways limited only by the power of their computers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early computer networks were piggybacked onto the existing infrastructure of the telephone system, and made use of simple communication protocols devised by computer scientists and enthusiasts. Over time, the complexity of networks has increased, as has the body of technical literature and specialist skills devoted to designing, building, and maintaining them. Today, most of the world's computer networks flow together seamlessly into the Internet, a world-spanning system that allows nearly anyone on Earth to communicate with anyone else, given computer access.</English>

<English>A telephone, from the Greek for 'distant voice,' is an device that converts a speaker's voice into electrical impulses, transmits them to a remote receiver, permits the speaker to receive other similar signals, and converts them back into voice. This permits conversations to be had between any two owners of telephones on the same switching network.

There is some debate over who invented the telephone. Many individuals were working to design them, with similar tools, throughout the 1860s and '70s. However, it is clear that within a few years of the first commercially successful telephones being created, systems of the devices were beginning to connect distant cities. The telephone allowed infinitely faster and richer exchanges of information than any pre-19th century mode of communication, and had great advantages compared to the slightly earlier telegraph as well.

Early telephone technology was highly diverse, but standardized as the 20th century began and as telephone systems became increasingly networked. It was found that while a specific telephone line from one place to another was valuable, a network permitting every user to call every other user was exponentially more valuable. Elaborate systems of manually operated "switchboards" emerged, allowing connections to be made at will between different telephones on the network.

Networks grew larger and the individual telephones grew more compact and user-friendly throughout the early and mid-20th centuries. After the computer revolution began in the 1950s and '60s, automated switching took the place of manually operated systems, touch-tone dialing replaced rotary phones, and long distance calls became a cheaper and more common activity connecting the world together.

The next great advance, mobile telephony, came in the 1970s and '80s, reaching maturity around the turn of the millenium. Cellular networks of transceiver towers make it possible for every citizen to carry a miniaturized wireless telephone, permitting near-instant communication throughout the world. Over the past decade, this technology has been further refined and combined with further miniaturization, allowing a single handheld device to serve as telephone, camera, appointment book, a portable device for audiovisual entertainment, and a gaming platform.</English>

		<English>Thermodynamics is a branch of physics concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question. The laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering.
 
Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars. Scottish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated, "Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency."</English>

		<English>Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".
 
Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_UNIFIED_THEORY_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>By late 20th century, physics had converged on a set of well understood theories to describe nature. But there are several gaps, defects, or vulnerabilities in this universal model. Firstly, this set of theories stands on two pillars. One is the nature of gravity, as outlined by Einstein's theory of "general relativity" in 1920 and refined since that time, which treats time and space as flexible things that can be warped by gravity. The other is "quantum field theory," which describes the behavior of subatomic particles, treating each particle as a special instance of a generalized, abstract field of force and probability that permeates the universe.

The problem is that quantum field theory, otherwise known as the Standard Model, assumes that time and space are fixed, inflexible, and invariant - that they are the constant and unchanging playing field on which particle interactions are allowed to happen. In other words, the Standard Model does not obey the theory of relativity. Therefore, it cannot be the whole story. General relativity appears to be a solid and essentially complete picture of a key part of reality, the Standard Model is not. It is solid, it explains the behavior of nearly all things that can be seen on Earth or elsewhere in the universe... but it is not complete.

The Standard Model explains almost all known phenomena, but some of the ones it cannot explain present very large issues. It does not explain the nature or origins of dark matter or dark energy and yet astronomers have reason to believe that these things make up 95% of all substance in the universe today. The Standard Model does not explain why the ghostly neutrino particles coming from the Sun appear to randomly reshuffle their nature, in a way the Standard Model deems impossible. The Standard Model predicts that in the beginning of the universe, matter and antimatter 'should' have been created in equal quantities, and devoured each other totally, leaving behind nothing but light and radiation in all of space. In hindsight, this appears not to have occurred. For this and other reasons, despite the Standard Model providing huge advances in our understanding compared to anything that came before it, it is not the last step.

Research into these matters is ongoing today. It is hoped that future physics will emerge which resolves some of these contradictions. In particular, it is hoped that these new physics will allow us to create a model of quantum physics that is consistent with Einstein's work on gravity - thus the name, "quantum gravity."</English>

		<English>Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the development and use of land, planning permission, protection and use of the environment, public welfare, and the design of the urban environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks. Urban planning is also referred to as urban and regional planning, regional planning, town planning, city planning, rural planning or some combination in various areas worldwide. It takes many forms and it can share perspectives and practices with urban design.
 
Urban planning guides orderly development in urban, suburban and rural areas. Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities, urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of water use and resources, rural and agricultural land, parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance. Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management.
 
Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering, and public administration to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals. Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields. Today urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline. The discipline is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as land-use planning, zoning, economic development, environmental planning, and transportation planning.</English>

Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals.
 
The Middles Ages saw continuous advances in financial tools, first in China, but later also in the Middle East and Europe. This enabled more successful organised cooperation between people, even over large geographic distances.
 
Companies were often established to engage in trading ventures or for similar business purposes, especially to facilitate long distance trade. A similar development took place in military organisation: private military companies were established who offered their services to various powers in small and large conflicts. The most prominent examples include Swiss mercenaries and Italian condottieri.</English>

	</TEXT>
	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_FORTIFICATION_PEDIA</Tag>
<English>Fortifications are structures built to aid in the defense of a point or area against attackers. Various types of fortification have existed since prehistoric times: the proto-city of Jericho was protected by a wall over three meters high as early as 9000 BCE, although this may have been as much a flood control measure as a military defense. The growth of civilization and advances in the killing power of weapons made fixed defenses ever more important.

The basic concept of walling a city is to deter casual raiders and force even a determined army into a protracted, costly siege. Incorporating defensible features into buildings, such as narrow windows and entryways, provides cover to defenders and make it hard for attackers to push into the building safely.

Advances in engineering during medieval times, and larger labor forces made available by advances in agriculture, allowed a great increase in the scale of defensive works. Entire provinces could be protected by walls like the famous Great Wall of China, or Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Individual points could be held with great castles and fortresses, strong enough that it would take years of siege to starve them out, as a mass assault by soldiers using normal means was guaranteed to fail.

This goal of demanding multi-year sieges became impractical with the invention of gunpowder-based artillery, but the art of fortification remained prominent. Architects devised new ways to build defenses that would absorb and deflect cannon fire, sheltering troops from enemy guns and channeling attackers into zones where the defenders' guns could be brought to bear.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_MYTHOLOGY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. Myth is a feature of every culture. Many sources for myths have been proposed, ranging from personification of nature or personification of natural phenomena, to truthful or hyperbolic accounts of historical events to explanations of existing rituals. A culture's collective mythology helps convey belonging, shared and religious experiences, behavioral models and moral and practical lessons.
 
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events. According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods. Other theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: Apollo represents the sun, Poseidon represents water, and so on. According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: Athena represents wise judgment, Aphrodite desire, and so on. Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the personification of inanimate objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them. According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual. In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.</English>
