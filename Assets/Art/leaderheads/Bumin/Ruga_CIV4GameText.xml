		<English>[H1]Ruga[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Huns[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 365 - c. 434/35[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ruga was ruler of the Huns from 425 to 434/435. He was an uncle of Bleda and Attila. At first, he shared the reign over the Huns with his brother Oktar. After the dead of his brother, he took over the sole reigns over the Huns on the Balkans. In 432, the roman military leader Aetius flew to him; with Rugas help,  Aetius was able to get the control over the western Roman Empire. In exchange, Aetius ceded Pannonia and Valeria to the Huns. Besides of this, Ruga also forced the Roman Empire to give up all the rogue Hunnish soldiers they had acquired over the years. This was a big event, because the Roman Empire had come to rely on all of their Hunnish soldiers. His most important act, though, was that he united the Huns under his sole kingship by 432.[NEWLINE][TAB]The circumstances of his death in 434 remain unclear, but it could be that his nephews were involved in that. Ruga was succeeded by his brother Mundzuk briefly, who was also rumoured to have had Ruga killed. For this, he was expelled and his sons Attila and Bleda became joint rulers of the united Hunnic tribes.</English>

		<German>[H1]Ruga[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Herrscher der Hunnen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 365 - ca. 434/35[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ruga war von etwa 425 bis 434/435 Herrscher der Hunnen. Er war ein Onkel Bledas und Attilas. Zunächst teilte sich Ruga die Herrschaft mit seinem Bruder Oktar, nach dessen Tod 430 übernahm Ruga die Führung über den Großteil der Hunnen auf dem Balkan. 432 floh der römische Heermeister Aetius zu ihm; dieser konnte mit Rugas Hilfe die Führung im Westreich übernehmen, wofür Aetius Pannonien und Valeria an die Hunnen abtrat. Außerdem brachte er Rom dazu auf alle hunnischen Söldner zu verzichten. Dies war von Bedeutung, da Rom mittlerweile abhängig von diesen Söldnern wurde. Seine größte Leistung war allerdings die Vereinigung der Hunnen unter seiner Herrschaft.[NEWLINE][TAB]Die Umstände seines Todes im Jahre 434 sind nicht ganz klar, womöglich waren seine Neffen daran beteiligt. Ihm folgte sein Bruder Mundzuk auf dem Thron, der möglicherweise ebenfalls mit Rugas Tod in Verbindung stand. Aus diesem Grunde wurde er auch wenig später vertrieben und seine Söhne Bleda und Attila übernahmen die Herrschaft.</German>

		<Hungarian>[H1]Ruga[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]A hunok uralkodója[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Élt:[\BOLD] kb. 365 - kb. 434/35[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Háttér:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]A hunok uralkodója 425-tõl 434/435-ig Bleda és Attila nagybátyja, Ruga volt. Kezdetben még bátyjával, Oktarral együtt uralkodott a hunok felett. Testvére halála után egyedüli uralkodóként vette át a balkáni hunok irányítását. 432-ben Aetius, a bajba került római hadvezér hozzá menekült; és végül Ruga segítségével szerezte meg a Nyugat-római Birodalom irányítását.[NEWLINE][TAB]A segítségért cserébe átengedte a hunoknak Pannóniát és Valeriát, illetve a Római Birodalom elengedte a hun zsoldosait. Ez azért különösen fontos, mert a Birodalom függött ezektõl a katonáktól, tehát e lépés nagyban hozzájárult a késõbbi római vereségekhez.[NEWLINE][TAB]Mindezek mellett Ruga legfontosabb tette az volt, hogy egyesítette a hun törzseket 432-ben, ezzel teremtve meg utódai, elsõsorban Attila számára az erõs hun egységet.[NEWLINE][TAB]Halálának körülményei nem tisztázottak, találgatások szerint még a trón várományosainak, unokaöccseinek - Bleda és Attila - is köze lehetett hozzá. Közvetlenül halála után másik testvére, Mundzuk vette át a hatalmát, de õt vádolták Ruga meggyilkolásával. Még ebben az évben elûzték õt és helyette a fiai kerültek a trónra.[NEWLINE][TAB]Attila ekkor állt a hunok élére, bár a legismertebb hun vezér ekkor még testvérével együtt kezdte meg uralkodását.</Hungarian>
