Original model by asioasioasio. I gave it a gloss map, damage states and damage textures. Special thanks to Refar and The Coyote for their help in figuring out how to get the damage textures working correctly.
Uses the mechanized infantry animation. The skin in the teamcolor folder make the flag teamcolored.
