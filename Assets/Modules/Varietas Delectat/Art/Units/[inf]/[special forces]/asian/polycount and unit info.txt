PolyCount for Asian Flavored Special Forces:
2667 (WARNING- HIGH-POLY. I SUGGEST TO LIMIT TO 1 PER FORMATION.)



Made mostly out of baal isidro's Chinese Marine unit. It already had the pack and 'chute, but used standard marine kfm. mechaerik simply placed it on the Para's kfm, then replaced the head with a Buddhist Missionary and added asioasioasio's british helmet, which was followed by a retexturing of the helmet and a genericification (if that's a word) of the Chinese Marine.



As a side note, the weapon he is carrying is meant to be a SAR-21, not the L85A2.
