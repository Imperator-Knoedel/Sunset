PolyCount for Russian Flavored Special Forces unit:
1779


The Russian Flavored Special Forces unit (or Spetsnaz) was made by taking the head of the Next War Anti-Tank guy, and putting it on the Paratrooper, who i'd given the AK-101 from the Next War Automaton. I then replaced the Para's body with a the marine, which i textured with a slightly modified version of the Russian flavored marine in HISTORY IN THE MAKING (not sure where Grave got it, he may have madfe it himself).


This one was relatively difficult, but i learned a lot throughout it. This is the first unit i've ever made EVER with Blender's help. Although most of the unit was made by using NifScope, i had to manually remove the Next War Anti-Tank unit's head, because even in my archives of units, not one had that head. I had tried doing something similar before, but failed multiple times. So this unit is special to me.
