PolyCount for Europe Flavored Special Forces:
2154 (wARNING: HIGH POLY. SUGGEST TO LIMIT TO ONE PER FORMATION.)


It took me forever to think of an idea for the Europe Special Forces, but i eventually settled on a slight reworking of the original Special Forces unit, with the Next War Anti-Tank Infantry's head. Then i simply reskinned the Navy SEAL and head to give it a more urban motif.
