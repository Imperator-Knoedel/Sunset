Armor Arjun
.
It doesn't exist the blueprints.
I've read that this Indian Modern Armor is similar to a big T72 with a turret similar 
to Leopard2A4... 
So I've uploaded the 3ds meshes on Snafusmith T72 (uses tank animations NOT included) 
and the turret from my Type 90 (a little reshaped), 

The traks are from type 97 Chi-Ha (reshaped). 
Texture:Snafusmith's T72 re-coloured 
Feel free to use it as You want.
