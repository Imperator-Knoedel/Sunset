Tank P26_40

modelled by me
added standard tracks

meshes uploaded on M4A3.nif (I still don't know the author)

Uses M4A3 animations, included

Original texture and BluePrint from the wonderful "STORIA DEI MEZZI CORAZZATI - Fratelli Fabbri Editori"
I have only few numbers of this old enciclopedy full of blueprints.

The original texture has german insignia, as the tank never served under Italy cause was soon requiside by germans,
but to play with the italians I made a texture with "Battaglioni M" (M Battalions) insignia

Feel free to use it as You want
