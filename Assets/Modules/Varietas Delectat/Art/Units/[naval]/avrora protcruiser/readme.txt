Cruiser Avrora For Civ4
================================================================================
The Russian Cruiser Avrora.

Animated with damage textures. FX and NonShader version inculded.
Teamcolored.
There is a alternative texture in the archive replacing the Andrejevskij flag
with a plain team colored one.

1350 Polys.
The main texture is 512x256 - its better for painting. Scaling it down to 
256x256 does loose a bit detail, but not a lot.

From all i know, the files will work with Vanilla and Warlords. However
only BTS was actually tested. 

Installation
================================================================================
This is not a playable Mod, just artwork.

     <fScale>1</fScale> (Or maybe a bit bigger)
     The <NIF> should be the normal .nif <ShaderNif> the *_FX.nif/
