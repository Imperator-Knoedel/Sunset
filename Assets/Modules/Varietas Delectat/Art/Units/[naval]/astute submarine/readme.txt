Astute Submarine For Civ4 BTS
================================================================================
From all i know, the unit will work with Vanilla and Warlords as well. However
only BTS was actually tested. 

The Archive contains a light (default) and a dark versions of the Texture. 
Choose which one you like and rename to AstuteDiffuse_256.dds

Installation
================================================================================
I suggest copying/using the ART_DEF_UNIT_SUBMARINE as base.
<NIF> --> AstuteSub.nif
<SHADERNIF> --> AstuteSub_FX.nif

If you are getting ptoblems with the FX version, or just do not like it, 
you can still use AstuteSub.nif for the shadernif as well.

<KFM> --> AstuteSub.kfm
<Button> --> AstuteSub.dds, if you wish to use the included Button.
Keep the submarines Sound defines or add them. 
	<TrainSound>AS2D_UNIT_BUILD_UNIT</TrainSound>
	<AudioRunSounds>
		<AudioRunTypeLoop>LOOPSTEP_SUBMARINE</AudioRunTypeLoop>
		<AudioRunTypeEnd>ENDSTEP_SUBMARINE</AudioRunTypeEnd>
	</AudioRunSounds>
	<SelectionSound>AS3D_UN_SUBMARINE_FORT</SelectionSound>
Suggestions for other relevant tags:
	<fScale>0.45</fScale> (0.45 will more or less fit the ship in one plot.
	If you like larger modern ships, values of 0.5 + might be better)
	<fInterfaceScale>1.2</fInterfaceScale>
	<fRangedDeathTime>0.6</fRangedDeathTime> (The Death animation is a bit
	longer as usual so give it a little time to play ;-)
	<ActionSound>AS3D_UN_SUBMARINE_FORT</ActionSound>
