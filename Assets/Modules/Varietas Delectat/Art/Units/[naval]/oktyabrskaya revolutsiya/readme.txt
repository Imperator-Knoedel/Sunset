Original model by GeneralMatt and skin by Danrell. I cleaned up the model quite a bit by removing unseen polys and uvmapping parts that weren't mapped correctly. I also added glossmaps, damage states and damage textures. I reboned the model to use the destroyer animation so that all four of its turrets fire. The two models differ in that the _norail has no railings on the model (duh).
