Fa-223
Original model by asioasioasio
Modified by Xenomorph
Uses included animations

I edited asiox3's excellent model to include gloss maps and damage states. This one was tricky, since asioasioasio used some custom animations and I had to edit them a bit to get the damage textures to work correctly. Some quick testing showed no problems.
I have included four different buttons and two alternate skins, one if you don't want my teamcolors (which changes the color of the cross on the side), and another that replaces the swastika with a generic teamcolor circle.
